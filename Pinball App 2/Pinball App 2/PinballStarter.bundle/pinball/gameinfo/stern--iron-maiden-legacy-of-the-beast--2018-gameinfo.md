Iron Maiden is a pinball machine by **Stern**, released in **2018**.

Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast is Keith Elwin’s first ever design for Stern Pinball. Using graphics and cutscenes from the video game of the same name, Iron Maiden puts the player in the role of Eddie, battling against other Eddies, collecting their cards, and finding treasure along the way. This table may have a unique layout, but the rules are accessible for everyone from novices to more advanced pinball players.
