Star Trek is a pinball machine by **Stern**, released in **2013**.

**General Mode Strategy** Shoot the matching colored shots for the modes to earn points and advance. Combos will double points that would’ve been earned. Once you hit one mode shot, you can shoot the ‘Away Team’ shot (under the upper flipper), which adds 20 seconds and changes the primary objective of the mode to some specific shots. Usually, it’s a pretty good idea to do so as the shots become much more valuable.
