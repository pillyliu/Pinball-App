***Harry Potter*** is JJP’s 2025 release and Eric Meunier’s fourth table designed for the company. The table is based on Warner Bros’ eight *Harry Potter* films, following the adventures of a wizard-in-training who attends a school made with them in mind and uncovers the secrets behind the school’s former students and the magic taught by them.

## <span id="heading--overview"></span>Rules Overview:

- Shoot the scoop to start terms (if one isn’t lit, hit the right spinner to light the scoop). Terms consist of 10 “lessons” and the player will move on to the next lesson if either time runs out during the lesson or they complete the required shots.
  - After 10 lessons have been played, final exam will start. Complete the required shots during the final exam to light the center orbit for OWLs multiball.
  - Complete 9 lessons to qualify the Deathly Hallows mini-wizard mode.
- Spell DIAGON at the center orbit to qualify one of the Diagon Alley shops. Use the action button or hit Hagrid’s standup target to change the lit shop.
- Shoot the allies target followed by either the inner loop or right orbit to enable super modes. Both ally factions have two super modes.
- Play all four multiballs to light Battle of Hogwarts mini-wizard mode.
  - Shoot the center and staircase ramps to light Explore Hogwarts multiball.
  - Spell HARRY at the inlanes and RON & HERMIONE at their targets to light the wand lock. Lock 3 balls to start Golden Trio multiball.
  - Shoot the drop target in front of the Death Eater to start a battle against one. Defeat two Death Eaters to light Death Eater multiball.
  - Shoot the left ramp to establish your position in the Quidditch match. During the match, rip the spinner to catch a total of three Snitches. Then, shoot the left ramp to start Quidditch World Cup multiball.
- Complete combos to light the scoop to advance wizard travel. The combo award alternates between timed “geminio” playfield X and other awards.
- Land the ball into the cauldron shot to begin browsing through potions. Shoot the left ramp, center ramp, or right orbit twice to collect the listed award.
- Shoot right orbit to light the left outlane for Fawkes ball save. Shoot three lit shots before time runs out to save your ball.
- Light the right outlane for Protego by spelling HARRY while the lock for Golden Trio multiball is already lit. This gate saves any ball about to drain there.

## <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots:

The game starts off with level 1 skill shots available. Once a level 1 skill shot is made, level 2 skill shots will become available, then level 3.

Press the action button to change the lit skill shot.

## <span id="heading--year"></span>School Year Modes / Lessons:

Harry, Ron and Hermione are enrolled at the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry for 6 years. The year modes reflect this by being a series of 10 mini-modes or “lessons” that end once time runs out or they are completed, concluded by a **[final exam](#heading--final)** mini-wizard mode.

Shoot the scoop to start a year when lit, and use the flipper buttons and action button to select the desired year. If “start term” isn’t lit, shoot the time-turner right spinner to light it. The lit shots during lessons are colored red & gold (ie. the Gryffindor house emblem).

Completing each lesson awards a time bonus (seconds remaining x 25k + 25k per each lesson completed in a row), and completing enough lessons will award random elements (at 2, 3, and 4 lessons played). Completing seven lessons during a game will light the scoop to start **[The Deathly Hallows](#heading--deathly)**.

**[Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes](#heading--diagon)** can award Bombtastic Bombs that allow players to complete a lesson during any term by pressing the action button.

## <span id="heading--diagon"></span>Diagon Alley:

Access the shops at Diagon Alley by shooting the center loop three times (+1 per shop, to a maximum of six shots). There are five shops to visit and the lit one can be changed either indirectly by hitting the Hagrid target near the center loop, or directly by pressing the action button.

- **Ollivander’s Wand Shop**: 30-second timed mode, shoot the lit double shots to boost the jackpot value during **[Golden Trio multiball](#heading--trio)**.
- **Flourish & Blotts**: Video mode. Memorize the spells which require flipper buttons or action button inputs in the correct order. Completing this video mode awards its respective **[horcrux](#heading--horcrux)**.
- **Owl Post**: Lights a random hurry-up shot for a value starting at 25M. The VUK will send the ball to whichever flipper is best suited to make the lit shot.
- **Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes**: Awards 10M and +2 Bombtastic Bombs. During **[lessons](#heading--year)**, pressing the action button will use up the Bomb and complete the currently active lesson.
- **Borgin & Burkes**: Can only be visited if the Knockturn Alley value has been built up over the course of the game’s four **[multiball modes](#heading--multiballs)**. Accessing this shop awards the built Knockturn Jackpot value.

## <span id="heading--multiballs"></span>Multiballs:

### <span id="heading--hogwarts"></span>Explore Hogwarts Multiball:

Shoot the lit center and right ramp shots to discover Hogwarts staircase paths - if any shot is lit during a **[lesson](#heading--terms)**, the staircase paths will always send the ball towards the flipper best used to hit it. Once enough have been discovered, the right ramp will start Explore Hogwarts multiball. The first Explore Hogwarts only takes two lit ramp shots to light.

All shots are lit to send the ball to four different playfield areas for jackpots, but once a jackpot is scored there, another shot has to be made to relight it. Collecting four jackpots lights a roving shot (from left to right) for super jackpot, which can be increased by continuing to score jackpots.

The super jackpot remains lit even once the multiball ends, if one hasn’t been scored yet.

### <span id="heading--trio"></span>Golden Trio Multiball:

Light the wand lock at the right orbit and upper loop by completing the spellouts for each member of the Golden Trio.

- HARRY: Complete the return lanes.
- RON: Complete the left standup targets.
- HERMIONE: Complete any of Hermione’s targets near the upper loop.

Each spellout lights one lock. Once three balls are locked at the wand, Golden Trio multiball will start.

There are three jackpot types: blue jackpots (left), red jackpots (center), and yellow jackpots (right). Collecting a jackpot of any type will require the RON, HARRY, or HERMIONE shots to be hit to relight them. Scoring three of any jackpot will light the right orbit and upper loop for wand jackpot, multiplied by +1x for every jackpot type scored, with an add-a-ball for the first wand jackpot of the multiball. The process then resets with more jackpots required to light the wand jackpot.

### <span id="heading--death"></span>Death Eater Multiball:

Shoot the left drop target to light Death Eater battle. During the battle, shoot the hole behind the drop target two times in 20 seconds to score 20M and defeat the Death Eater (and light **[extra ball](#heading--extraballs)** the first time one is defeated during a game). Defeating the second Death Eater will light the hole to start Death Eater multiball and kill the flippers. All other game rules are disabled while Death Eater multiball is running.

Death Eater Multiball is split into four stages:

- **Hurry-up**: the value starts at 1M. At thresholds of 800k and 400k, the number of death eaters that must be killed during the multiball decreases by 1.
- **Jackpots**: green shots score the locked in hurry-up value and decrease the health of each death eater by 1/2.
- **Super jackpots**: shoot any shot on the right (scoop, right spinner, behind flipper) for 5M x the number of death eaters that were killed.
- **Frenzy**: all red shots score ?

### <span id="heading--quidditch"></span>Quidditch World Cup:

At the start of the game, the very first left ramp shot will start Quidditch tryouts. This mode can only be activated once per game - hitting any shot on the upper playfield twice (snitch, target, ramp, or loop) will advance the player’s position (from worst to best: beater, chaser, keeper, seeker).

Hit shots on the upper playfield to start a Quidditch match. During the match, shooting the spinner and the ramp on the upper playfield will qualify the goal post captive ball targets to score a goal. Alternatively, whenever a match starts, a random shot’s white insert will rove across the playfield. This insert is called the “Snitch” and catching it will complete the match without having to complete the upper playfield shots.

After completing three matches (one against each rival house), the next left ramp shot will start Quidditch World Cup multiball. Shoot the green shots to score jackpots, with the left ramp lit to score larger jackpots associated with the Bulgaria region of Ireland. After scoring enough jackpots (four the first time, six the second, etc.) all jackpot shots will turn to increasing the value of the super jackpot, scored with repeated shots to the ramp on the upper playfield with a multiplier that increases every time the ramp shot is made.

## <span id="heading--other"></span>Other Scoring:

### <span id="heading--potter"></span>Potter Frenzy:

This mode starts after spelling HARRY at the return lanes 3 times, regardless of whether his **[Golden Trio lock](#heading--trio)** is lit or not. For the next 40 seconds, all switches score a random value between 50k and 100k points, and a different voice clip from the movies of a character saying “Potter”.

### <span id="heading--extraballs"></span>Extra Balls:

Light extra balls at the hole behind the upper flipper by:

- Defeating a **[Death Eater](#heading--death)** (once per game)

### <span id="heading--endofgame"></span>Quidditch Bonus:

Bonuses are given for all players’ Quidditch performance at the end of the final ball of the game:

- 150 points per Snitch caught
- 10 points per goal

all multiplied by the position value that they set with the first left ramp shot of the game (beater - 100k, chaser - 150k, keeper - 200k - seeker - 300k).

During multiplayer games, the game keeps track of the Quidditch MVP - the player who scored the most points from Quidditch during a game. The Quidditch MVP receives 10M x the number of players who were in the multiplayer match, up to a max of 40M.
