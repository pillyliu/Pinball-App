## Overview

AC/DC is an incredible collaboration between Steve Ritchie, Lyman Sheats, and the rest of the team at Stern Pinball, based on everyone’s favorite band of sweating tiny Australian men. AC/DC offers a mix of strategic options, and challenges players to continue mixing up their play to meet the game’s goals. Three major game mechanics all work together: a player-selected song influences scoring, shots build up a collectible Song Jackpot, and everything (including the Song Jackpot) can be collected with a timed 2x or 3x playfield multiplier.

These mechanics combine to make scoring on AC/DC explosive. No lead is safe, and huge scores can be achieved in more than one manner.

I have turned off commenting on this document due to repeated defacing. Send suggestions via email.

<a id="heading--prole"></a>
## Pro / LE

Like most recent Stern Pinball machines, there is a Pro and an LE (Limited Edition) model of AC/DC. There are many differences, including a lower playfield, drop targets, and other feature changes. This rule sheet will note when an LE feature is different from a Pro feature.

Note: there are multiple different AC/DC LE and Premium versions. All have the same layout and rules. Throughout, game settings are described using defaults.

<a id="heading--specialthanks"></a>
## Special Thanks

A huge thank-you goes to Lyman Sheats for offering to describe some helpful AC/DC strategies along with the inner workings of the rules.

A big thanks to Sean DonCarlos, whose AC/DC rule sheet here predates this one, and includes a large amount of great information that is also compiled here.

Special thanks to those who donated to Pinball Outreach Project (http://pinballoutreach.org). Donations to PoP led to the creation of this work.

<a id="heading--faq"></a>
## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What song should I pick?**  
A: See “Ranking the Songs” for some options. If you’re new to AC/DC, War Machine is a pretty clear choice. Hells Bells seems to give the most points, especially on the LE.

**Q: How do I get multiball?**  
A: Collect enough ramps, target banks, or loops, then shoot the right ramp. In general, Jam (ramps) is easiest to reach.

**Q: What do I do during multiball?**  
A: The same thing you did to get to that multiball. Jam Jackpots are ramps, Album Jackpots are target banks, Tour Jackpots are loops.

**Q: People fire the cannon into the bell instead of awards. Why?**  
A: Hitting the bell 3 times doubles scoring, which can be worth a lot. The bell is also less drain-risky than the AC/DC bank. Some players prefer to shoot the spinner, which is even less risky.

**Q: What do the red “devil horns” do?**  
A: Nothing important. They award a small number of points. It is commonly thought the horns relight the mini-playfield on the LE, but this is not true: that happens by shooting the five Musical Notes.

<a id="heading--layout"></a>
## Playfield Layout

This section describes, briefly, the location and basic rules for the AC/DC playfield. This is roughly clockwise, from left to right.

**Left inlane / outlane:** Award letters in FIRE when unlit. When flashing (via Super Lanes), outlane scores Double Bonus or Triple Bonus, inlane doubles next shot.

**AC/DC targets:** Five-bank of targets, completing the targets advances toward Album Multiball. Also used to collect Cannon awards. On the LE this is a drop target bank.

**Left loop:** Spinner, advances toward Tour Multiball. Shots return through the right loop; soft shots feed the top lanes. One of the five Musical Note shots.

**Lightning bolt targets:** Three standups, one on each side of the left ramp and one to the right of the right ramp.

**Left ramp:** Advances toward Jam Multiball. Returns to left inlane. On the LE this shot feeds the Cannon when lit for awards, but will not start lit multiballs. One of the five Musical Note shots.

**Bell:** Center shot. Counts down to playfield multiplier, and resets playfield multiplier timer. On the LE the Bell is a swinging ball with a saucer behind it, and a lane behind the swinging ball feeds the spinner return. Used to collect Cannon awards, notably multiball Super Jackpots. One of the five Musical Note shots.

**TNT targets:** Three-bank of targets, completing the targets advances toward Album Multiball. On the LE this is a drop target bank, with a standup behind the middle target.

**Right ramp:** Advances toward Jam Multiball. Returns to right inlane. Feeds the Cannon when lit for awards or multiballs. Starts all multiballs. One of the five Musical Note shots.

**Right loop:** Advances toward Tour Multiball. Feeds the Jukebox saucer and the top lanes. One of the five Musical Note shots.

**Jukebox:** Saucer at top middle, fed by plunge or right loop. Drops ball into top lanes, except during Super Skill Shot. Selects song when lit.

**AXE lanes:** Standard top lanes score Skill Shot. Adds +1 Bonus X when completed.

**Bumpers:** Three in standard configuration below top lanes. Each bumper hit counts down to an advance in bumper level.

**ROCK targets:** Four-bank of targets, completing the targets advances toward Album Multiball.

**Right inlane / outlane:** Award letters in FIRE when unlit. When flashing (via Super Lanes), outlane scores Double Bonus or Triple Bonus, inlane doubles next shot.

**Cannon:** Sits above right outlane. Fire at lit targets.

**Hell Mini-Playfield (LE only):** Available during three “Hell” songs: *Highway To Hell*, *Hells Bells*, and *Hell Ain’t A Bad Place To Be*. When lit, enter Hell via the right ramp (Highway), the center saucer (Bells), or the Jukebox (Bad Place). Hell has a left and right loop and three center targets. The ball is launched automatically through the right loop. All play in Hell is on a countdown timer, and the main playfield resumes when time expires. Each Hell mode is different; see song details.

<a id="heading--extraballs"></a>
## Extra Balls, Specials, and Free Games

There aren’t very many ways to earn an extra ball on AC/DC, but here they are:

- 2 completions of the full set of AC/DC, TNT, and ROCK targets  
- 25 Combos + every 100 Combos

Extra Balls are collected on the right loop. During tournament play, Extra Balls are worth **2,500,000**. The 2,500,000 can be multiplied by a playfield multiplier, but not by a Super Lanes shot (see Playfield Multiplier for details).

A **Special** can be lit in these two ways:

- 5 completions of the full set of AC/DC, TNT, and ROCK targets  
- Completing all albums during Album Multiball

Specials are collected by completing a new set of AC/DC, TNT, and ROCK targets. During tournament play, Specials are worth **5,000,000**, and can also be multiplied by a playfield multiplier.

AC/DC replay score changes based on play. If you make a replay at base value, the next game’s replay will be 2x the base, then 3x the base, etc. Grand Champion and #1 high scores also award free games.

<a id="heading--vip"></a>
## VIP Passes

VIP Passes are earned through Skill Shots, and an additional VIP Pass is awarded for every 50 “Song Requests”, where 1 Song Request is a completion of a song task (a loop, ramp, target or lane completion, or bumper level). VIP Passes are used by pressing the fire button when it is lit solid.

VIP Passes can be used to collect a shot associated with the current song. The game selects which shot is awarded: in general, it is the next shot to progress through the song, though there are exceptions. Points and progress are awarded as though the shot were hit.

VIP Passes stack, and carry over from ball to ball. There is no need to “spend” a VIP Pass as the ball drains, but you should burn them off at the end of the final ball.

**Strategy:** VIP Passes are primarily used during multiball, where they count toward the add-a-ball awarded for the first completion of the five Musical Note shots. On the LE, VIP Passes trigger the Bell during *Hells Bells*, advancing or awarding playfield multiplier. Be careful using VIP Passes during modes like *T.N.T.* or *Let There Be Rock* where the Musical Note shots may not be lit immediately.

<a id="heading--skillshot"></a>
## Skill Shot / Super Skill Shot

The standard Skill Shot drops the ball from the Jukebox to the AXE lanes. Use lane change, and earn **250,000** (+25,000 each time), along with **+2 Bonus X** and **1 VIP Pass**.

The **Super Skill Shot** is activated by holding in the right flipper as the ball leaves the Jukebox. The Jukebox will kick the ball at full strength through the right loop. Making any of the Musical Note shots within 5 seconds scores **350,000** (+25,000 more each time), along with **+5 Bonus X** and **2 VIP Passes**. If selecting a song in the Jukebox at the start of a ball, you must still hold in the right flipper.

**Strategy:**  
There is a significant difference in value between these Skill Shots. A VIP Pass can be worth millions, so the Super Skill Shot is a risk–reward between 2 VIP Passes or nothing. Unless you are shooting poorly, have a specific need for 1 VIP Pass, or are playing a song involving the top lanes or bumpers, it is generally a better idea to go for the Super Skill Shot.

On the LE during *Hells Bells*, you can use a VIP Pass to collect the Super Skill Shot, guaranteeing collection if you miss.

<a id="heading--pfmultiplier"></a>
## Playfield Multiplier

The playfield multiplier available from the Bell is one of the most significant features of AC/DC, and is a major key in unlocking the game’s huge scoring potential.

- With **three shots** to the Bell, **2x scoring** activates for 20 seconds.  
- With a **fourth** shot, the 2x timer is reset to 20 seconds.  
- With a **fifth** shot, the 2x timer is reset again.  
- With a **sixth** shot, **3x scoring** activates for 20 seconds.  
- Further Bell shots reset the 3x timer to 20 seconds.

The status of the 2x or 3x timer can be seen on the playfield through the flashing lights. The faster the light blinks, the closer it is to the end of 20 seconds.

The 20-second timer freezes any time a ball is:
- In a saucer  
- In the Cannon  
- On the LE mini-playfield  

The timer does **not** freeze while the ball is in the bumpers.

At any time, you can use **Status Report** to see the number of Bell shots necessary to activate 2x scoring. Progress toward 2x is held between balls, which can be useful in starting 2x at the beginning of a multiball.

**Strategy:**  
Activating and maintaining a playfield multiplier—especially during multiball—is probably the most important key to great scores on AC/DC. It is even more important on the LE, since Hell scoring can be doubled or tripled while the timer is frozen.

2x and 3x shots raise the Song Jackpot faster, which can then be collected at the multiplied value. One ideal LE stack: play *Highway to Hell*, start a multiball, light the lower playfield, hit the Bell to reach 3x during multiball, spell FIRE to light Song Jackpot, load the Cannon when multiball ends, play the lower playfield at 3x, then collect the Song Jackpot at 3x.

<a id="heading--songs-songjackpot"></a>
## Songs and the Song Jackpot

At the start of the game, and whenever shooting a lit Jukebox, you pick a song that activates bonus scoring on specific playfield features. In order on the Jukebox:

- You Shook Me All Night Long (bumpers) | Back In Black (AC/DC targets)  
- Highway To Hell (right ramp / HELL) | War Machine (spinner)  
- Rock N Roll Train (left ramp) | For Those About To Rock (FIRE lanes)  
- Whole Lotta Rosie (top lanes) | T.N.T. (TNT targets)  
- Hells Bells (Bell / HELL) | Hell Ain’t A Bad Place To Be (right loop / HELL)  
- Thunderstruck (blue targets) | Let There Be Rock (ROCK targets)

Details of play and scoring for each song are in later sections.

The currently active song always flashes on the Jukebox. To light the Jukebox for a song change, light **eight other songs** by completing their associated tasks:

- One shot to each loop, ramp, and the Bell  
- One full completion of AC/DC, TNT, ROCK, and Thunderstruck  
- One completion of lanes (FIRE / AXE)  
- One bumper level via countdown  

You can earn these completions during multiball. The Jukebox is frequently lit when multiball ends. You cannot collect the Jukebox during multiball.

When the Jukebox is hit, you may change your song. Changing songs scores **50,000 per solidly lit song**, increased to **750,000** if all 11 are lit, plus **500,000 for each previous song played**. A playfield multiplier can make this very large.

Changing songs is optional: you may continue with the same song, but you lose the 500,000-per-song bonus. Lit songs reset either way.

While playing a song, any points earned from song shots are also added to the **Song Jackpot**. Its base is **1,000,000**, plus **500,000** for each completed song, with no maximum.

The Song Jackpot is lit:
- At the start of a game  
- After each **three completions of FIRE**

The Song Jackpot resets to its base value when collected and at the end of each ball.

Collect the Song Jackpot by loading the Cannon, then hitting the center AC/DC target. Like everything else, it can be collected during 2x or 3x scoring. If you miss the Cannon shot or fail to fire, you must complete FIRE three more times.

In **Tour Multiball** and **Album Multiball**, it is possible to collect the Song Jackpot’s value as a **Song Bonus** without resetting the Song Jackpot.

Status Report shows:
- Current Song Jackpot value  
- Number of FIRE completions needed to light the Cannon  

The high score table tracks the largest collected Song Jackpot.

**Strategy:**  
Cash in medium-sized Song Jackpots unless deliberately going for a huge collect. Very small Song Jackpots—especially early in a ball—can often be ignored; fire the Cannon into the Bell or spinner instead. If a large collect is ready, it is often worth risking 2x before collecting. Going for 3x is usually not worth the extra risk, except during multiball.

<a id="heading--supermodes"></a>
## Super Modes

During each song, completing an initial task lights the five **Musical Note** shots: the ramps, loops, and Bell. At this time, one of the four white lights in the bottom center of the playfield will begin to blink. These are the four **Super Modes**. The blinking one becomes active (and strobing) after **three more mode awards** (typically Musical Note shots).

Hitting a **lightning bolt target** rotates the blinking Super Mode counterclockwise until it is begun (and locked in) with the third mode award.

Once a Super Mode begins, it runs until the end of the ball. Multiple Super Modes can be active on the same ball, and new ones become available when changing songs via the Jukebox.

The four Super Modes, in counterclockwise order, are:

**Super Targets**  
“Target bank combos active. 2x second bank, 3x third bank.”  
If you hit two or three different target banks with the same shot, the second hit is doubled and the third is tripled. This is especially powerful during Album Multiball, where it can award a 2x or 3x Song Bonus.

**Super Lanes**  
“Inlane = timed 2x shot. Outlane = double/triple bonus.”  
After completing FIRE, one controlled FIRE lane flashes. A flashing inlane doubles the next shot. A flashing outlane doubles bonus (or triples it if already doubled).

**Super Loops**  
“Loops 250,000 / 500,000.”  
Generally the least impactful Super Mode.

**Super Combos**  
“Combos 2x.”  
More valuable than it first appears, since combos are frequent and high-value.

There are four Jackpots available from target banks, lanes, loops, and combos. These Jackpots are built and collected independently of the Super Modes.

**Strategy:**  
- If lining up a **Song Bonus via Tour Multiball**, Super Lanes is strongest.  
- If lining up a **Song Bonus via Album Multiball**, Super Targets is strongest.  
- Otherwise, Super Combos can be the best long-term value.

During multiball, Super Targets can be exploited by using a second ball to hit a second bank.

Super Lanes should usually be cashed immediately unless something huge is set up, since it impedes progress toward FIRE. You cannot double a Song Jackpot or any Cannon shot with Super Lanes, but you *can* double a Song Bonus during Album or Tour Multiball. A Super Lanes inlane is also a great time to use a VIP Pass.

<a id="heading--combos"></a>
## Combos

Available Combos are:

- After a **left loop**, shoot the **left ramp** or **Bell**.  
- After a **left ramp**, shoot the **right ramp** or **right loop**.  
- After a **right ramp**, shoot the **left loop**, **left ramp**, or **Bell**.

No Combos are available from the Bell or right loop.

Combos start at **250,000** and increase by **5,000 per Combo**. Combo value does not reset between balls and caps at **500,000**. During Super Combos, values are doubled, making Combos worth **500,000–1,000,000**.

Each Combo adds value to the **Combo Jackpot**, which is available every **20 Combos**. Each Combo adds **250,000** to the Jackpot; Super Combos add **500,000**.

<a id="heading--cannon"></a>
## Firing the Cannon

When lit, load the Cannon and fire to collect awards. Possible Cannon awards include:

- Song Jackpot  
- Collect Bonus (every 8 bumper levels)  
- Target Bank Jackpot (every 10 target bank completions)  
- Lane Jackpot (every 10 FIRE completions)  
- Loop Jackpot (every 15 loops)  
- Combo Jackpot (every 20 combos)  
- Multiball Jackpot (up to 3), when starting a multiball  
- Multiball Super Jackpot  
- For Those About To Rock awards (up to 5)

Load the Cannon by shooting the **right ramp**. On the LE, the **left ramp** can also load the Cannon for any award other than a multiball start.

- Song Jackpot is usually collected via the **center AC/DC target**.  
- Multiball Super Jackpots are collected via the **Bell**.  
- Other awards cluster near the AC/DC targets.  

If more than five awards are available, the Bell and TNT targets may also be offered. On the LE, a drop target bank will reset if any targets are lit for Cannon awards.

If at least one award is collected, the Cannon remains lit and can be reloaded to collect others. On a total miss or if you choose not to fire, all awards disappear except multiball Super Jackpots and *For Those About To Rock* awards.

During *Highway to Hell* on the LE, the Cannon can be loaded even with no awards lit to hold the ball for the mini-playfield. In this case the Cannon autofires into the TNT targets—avoid this unless intentional.

**Strategy:**  
The Cannon is a drain risk when firing into AC/DC or TNT. Ignore low-value awards when possible; fire into the Bell or spinner instead. With a large Song Jackpot ready, consider collecting a secondary award first to keep the Song Jackpot lit while working toward 2x or 3x.

<a id="heading--multiballs"></a>
## Multiballs

There are three primary multiballs:

- **Jam Multiball:** light by shooting **6 ramps**  
- **Album Multiball:** light by completing **3 target banks**  
- **Tour Multiball:** light by shooting **8 loops**

When ready, the multiball light flashes. Shoot the **right ramp** to start, with a short ball saver.

At multiball start, fire the Cannon to collect an opening Jackpot. This scores points but does not count toward Super Jackpot progress.

During multiball:
- Shoot ramps, target banks, or loops to score Jackpots  
- After enough Jackpots, the **Super Jackpot** lights  
- Collect Super Jackpot by loading the Cannon and firing into the **Bell**

Completing all five Musical Note shots during multiball adds **one ball once**, and activates another short ball saver. Musical Notes made during a song carry into multiball.

You cannot progress toward other multiballs during multiball. After a multiball ends, it takes **two more** ramps/banks/loops (up to 20 max) to relight the same multiball.

Status Report shows progress toward all three multiballs.

**Strategy:**  
VIP Passes are best used to secure the add-a-ball. If one Musical Note remains and you have a VIP Pass, you effectively have an unlimited ball saver until you use it or hit the shot. Changing songs before starting multiball is usually smart, since Jukebox requirements are often completed during multiball.

Good general multiball songs include *Hells Bells*, *Whole Lotta Rosie*, *You Shook Me All Night Long*, and *Thunderstruck*.

<a id="heading--jammb"></a>
## Jam Multiball

Jam Multiball is a **2-ball** multiball. It is lit by making **6 ramps**, then started on the **right ramp**. Subsequent Jam Multiballs require **8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, then 20 ramps**.

During Jam Multiball:
- Either ramp scores a **Jackpot**.
- After a ramp is made, it briefly shuts off.
- The opposite ramp scores a **Double Jackpot** if made as a combo.

Jam Multiball’s base Jackpot value is **150,000**. The value increases:
- **+10,000** each time a Thunderstruck target is hit
- **+20,000** each time a Jam Jackpot is made  

Maximum base Jackpot: **750,000**.

After making **20 Jam Jackpots** across any number of Jam Multiballs, the **Super Jackpot** lights. It is worth the **sum of all Jam Jackpots made plus 1,000,000**. Load the Cannon and fire into the **Bell** to collect.

- If you miss, you may reload immediately.
- After collecting a Super Jackpot, **5 ramps** are required to relight it.
- Those ramps score Jackpot value but do **not** add to the Super Jackpot total.
- Each subsequent Super requires **2 more ramps** (7, then 9, etc.).

It is possible to collect the Super Jackpot **after Jam Multiball ends**, but only on the same ball.

**Strategy:**  
Jam is the easiest multiball to start and is often a strong default plan if you shoot ramps well. Alternating ramps is worth more (via Combos) but carries more risk due to cross-field shots.

Best songs to bring into Jam:
- *Rock N Roll Train*
- *Hells Bells*
- *For Those About To Rock*
- *Highway to Hell* (good, but weaker in v1.68)

Backhanding ramps can improve control. Remember that the Super Jackpot value reflects *all* Jam Jackpots scored, so stacking 2x/3x playfield and Super Lanes dramatically boosts its payoff. Shooting the Bell when starting Jam is usually optimal to begin building a multiplier.

<a id="heading--albummb"></a>
## Album Multiball

Album Multiball is a **3-ball** multiball. It is lit by completing **3 target banks**, then started on the **right ramp**. Later Album Multiballs require **5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, then 20 banks**.

During Album Multiball:
- Completing **AC/DC**, **TNT**, or **ROCK** scores a **Jackpot**.
- Lights in front of each bank show progress.
- Progress on unfinished banks is preserved when another bank is completed.

Album Multiball’s base Jackpot value is **150,000** and increases whenever:
- A target is hit
- A target bank is completed
- An Album Jackpot is made  

Maximum base Jackpot: **1,500,000**.

If you complete target banks **left to right**, you earn a **Double Jackpot**. Jackpots can also be multiplied via:
- Playfield multiplier (Bell)
- **Super Targets**

Each Album Jackpot is named after AC/DC albums in release order. If the current song appears on that album, you earn a **Song Bonus** equal to the **Song Jackpot value**.  
- The Song Bonus **does not reset** the Song Jackpot.
- The Song Bonus cannot be doubled by left-to-right completion.

### Album list and Song Bonus associations

- **High Voltage** — *T.N.T.*  
- **Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap** — none  
- **Let There Be Rock** — *Let There Be Rock*, *Whole Lotta Rosie*  
- **Powerage** — none  
- **Highway To Hell** — *Highway To Hell*  
- **Back In Black** — *Back In Black*, *Hells Bells*, *You Shook Me All Night Long*  
- **For Those About To Rock** — *For Those About To Rock*  
- **Flick Of The Switch** — none  
- **Fly On The Wall** — none  
- **Blow Up Your Video** — none  
- **The Razors Edge** — *Thunderstruck*  
- **Ballbreaker** — none  
- **Stiff Upper Lip** — none  
- **Black Ice** — *Rock N Roll Train*, *War Machine*

(If set to Australia/New Zealand, **T.N.T. Australia** appears after *High Voltage*, and *T.N.T.* moves to that album.)

After making **14 (or 15)** Album Jackpots, the **Super Jackpot** lights for the total of all Album Jackpots made plus **1,000,000** (Song Bonuses do not count). Load the Cannon and fire into the **Bell** to collect.

- If you miss, you can reload immediately.
- After collecting, **3 banks** are required to relight.
- Subsequent Supers require **2 more banks** each (5, then 7, etc.).
- Super Jackpot can be collected after multiball ends, on the same ball.

**Strategy:**  
Album Multiball is generally the **least valuable** multiball for raw scoring and involves risky shots. Its true value lies in earning **Song Bonuses**. Consider avoiding Album until your Song Jackpot is large.

Best songs for Album:
- *Hells Bells*
- *Thunderstruck*
- Target-based songs (*Back In Black*, *T.N.T.*, *Let There Be Rock*)

Use Status Report to see which album is next and pick songs to line up Song Bonuses. Remember: Song Bonus is affected by playfield multiplier—stack 2x/3x whenever possible. Super Targets can dramatically increase Album Jackpot value, especially by using multiple balls to hit different banks.

<a id="heading--tourmb"></a>
## Tour Multiball

Tour Multiball is a **2-ball** multiball. It is lit by completing **8 loops** (either through the Spinner or toward the Jukebox), then started on the **right ramp**. Subsequent Tour Multiballs require **10, 12, 14, 16, 18, then 20 loops**.

During Tour Multiball:
- Either loop scores a **Jackpot**.
- After a loop is made, the *other* loop scores a **Double Jackpot** for a few seconds.

Tour Multiball’s base Jackpot value is **200,000** and increases by **25,000** each time the **Bell** is hit or a Tour Jackpot is made.  
Maximum base Jackpot: **750,000**.

Each Tour Jackpot is named after AC/DC tours in order. If the current song is associated with that tour, you earn a **Song Bonus** equal to the **Song Jackpot value** (does not reset the Song Jackpot).

### Tour list and Song Bonus associations

- **Fly On The Wall** — none  
- **Who Made Who** — none  
- **Blow Up Your Video** — none  
- **The Razors Edge** — *Thunderstruck*  
- **Ballbreaker** — none  
- **Stiff Upper Lip** — none  
- **Club Dates / Rolling Stones** — none  
- **Black Ice** — *Rock N Roll Train*, *War Machine*

After making **20 Tour Jackpots** across any number of Tour Multiballs, the **Super Jackpot** lights for the total of all Tour Jackpots made plus **1,000,000** (Song Bonuses do not count). Load the Cannon and fire into the **Bell** to collect.

- If you miss, reload immediately.
- After collecting, **4 loops** are required to relight.
- Subsequent Supers require **2 more loops** each (6, then 8, etc.).
- Super Jackpot can be collected after multiball ends, on the same ball.

**Strategy:**  
Tour Multiball balances frequent Jackpots with the chance to earn Song Bonuses. Choose songs based on Song Jackpot value and proximity to a Song Bonus. *War Machine* is the strongest Tour song because repeated spinner shots score Jackpots. Consider saving it for later Tours when Song Bonuses are more likely.

Trapping a ball on the left flipper and looping the spinner with the other ball(s) is very effective. *Whole Lotta Rosie* and *You Shook Me All Night Long* are helpful if you prefer bumper/top-lane feeds. If the song does not match Tour well, don’t panic—Jackpots remain valuable.

<a id="heading--doublemb"></a>
## Double Multiball

Two multiballs can be started together by qualifying the required ramps, target banks, and loops. Double Multiball uses:
- **4 balls** if Album Multiball is involved
- **3 balls** otherwise

At the start of Double Multiball, the Cannon shot is available for **both opening Jackpots**, each **doubled** in value. There is no change to:
- Jackpot values during multiball
- Super Jackpot availability

If two Super Jackpots light simultaneously, both can be collected with a single shot to the **Bell**.

**Strategy:**  
Generally avoid Double Multiball. It trades away an entire extra multiball for modest immediate gains. If you are close to Double Multiball, start one multiball first and save the other for later.

If you do play Double Multiball, bumper-feeding songs (*Whole Lotta Rosie*, *You Shook Me All Night Long*) gain value, since balls can be parked while other shots are made.

In 4-ball Double Multiball, be cautious about completing all five Musical Notes too quickly—you may receive only a ball saver instead of an added ball.

<a id="heading--triplemb"></a>
## Triple Multiball

All three multiballs can be started together by qualifying the required ramps, target banks, and loops. Triple Multiball is a **4-ball** multiball.

At the start:
- The Cannon shot is available for **all three opening Jackpots**
- Each opening Jackpot is **tripled**

There is no change to:
- Jackpot values during multiball
- Super Jackpot availability

If two or three Super Jackpots light together, all can be collected with a single shot to the **Bell**.

A **Triple Multiball Jackpot** is also available at the Bell:
- Lit at the start of Triple Multiball
- After scoring one **Jam**, one **Album**, and one **Tour** Jackpot, the Triple Multiball Jackpot lights
- Value is based on the total of the other Jackpots collected

**Strategy:**  
Triple Multiball has a very high opportunity cost—you could have played three separate multiballs instead. Even with the added Triple Multiball Jackpot, it is rarely optimal, though worth attempting once or twice.

Because all four balls are in play, be careful completing the five Musical Notes too quickly or you may only receive a ball saver.

Best songs for Triple Multiball:
- *Hells Bells* (excellent Bell access; on the LE, VIP Passes swing the Bell and progress multiplier)
- *For Those About To Rock* (easy Bell access via Cannon)
- *Whole Lotta Rosie* and *You Shook Me All Night Long* (bumper parking)
- *Thunderstruck* (frequent incidental target hits)

<a id="heading--songs-general"></a>
## Songs: General Scoring

Whenever you pick a new song, it begins with a small opening task. Completing that task lights the five **Musical Note** shots for an award. Typically, Musical Note shots shut off when hit, but you can complete the opening task again to relight them. In most songs, completing all Musical Notes also relights them.

Each song shot has an assigned **base value**. Shots actually score between **100% and 200%** of this base, depending on progress during the game. Values are written as:

**350,000 + 2%**

This means the base value is 350,000, and each successful shot adds 2% to all song shots. Example:
- First shot: 350,000  
- Second shot: 357,000 (102%)  
- Third shot: 364,000 (104%)

The maximum value for any shot is **200% of base**.

When shot values increase, the increase applies to **all song shots for the rest of the ball**, even if you change songs. This allows you to build value in one song and cash it in with another.

Completing all five Musical Notes during a song awards a **permanent +6% boost** to all song shots for the rest of the game (once per song, up to the 200% cap). You must change songs to earn it again. Completing all five Musical Notes also adds **2,500,000** to the Song Jackpot and can be earned multiple times per song.

Note: Some song scoring details are incomplete or approximate.

<a id="heading--song-you-shook-me"></a>
### You Shook Me All Night Long (bumpers)
*(Album #6, Tour #10)*

**Opening task:** Complete 1 bumper level **or** shoot both loops.

Bumpers are worth more than usual. Completing a bumper level lights Musical Notes. Shooting both loops scores **250,000 + 2%** and also lights Musical Notes.

Musical Notes are worth **250,000 + 2%**. Completing a bumper level relights Musical Notes and adds **+2%**.

**Strategy:**  
Mid-list for Album and Tour, making it a good mid-game pick. Pairs well with Album or Tour Multiball due to frequent bumper action. Not a huge scorer, but solid if bumpers are active or loop catches are difficult.

<a id="heading--song-highway-to-hell"></a>
### Highway to Hell (right ramp / HELL)
*(Album #5, Tour #9)*

**Opening task:** Shoot right ramp.

Right ramp scores **125,000** and lights Musical Notes for **350,000 + 2%**. On the LE, ramps can feed the Hell mini-playfield when multiball is not running.

Mini-playfield shots score **150,000 + 2%**, with a final strobing shot worth **300,000 + 2%**. Timer freezes playfield multiplier.

**Strategy:**  
Medium-tier song in v1.68. Best paired with Jam Multiball. On the LE, avoid loading the Cannon when no awards are lit—autofire into TNT is dangerous.

<a id="heading--song-rock-n-roll-train"></a>
### Rock N Roll Train (left ramp)
*(Album #14, Tour #20)*

**Opening task:** Shoot left ramp, then right ramp / right loop / ROCK.

Left ramp scores **125,000** and lights other shots for **400,000 + 2%**. Musical Notes are worth **350,000 + 2%**.

**Strategy:**  
Best paired with Jam Multiball. Repeated left ramp shots alone are low value; focus on completing the task to relight Musical Notes.

<a id="heading--song-whole-lotta-rosie"></a>
### Whole Lotta Rosie (top lanes)
*(Album #3, Tour #6)*

**Opening task:** Roll over any **lit** top lane.

Lit lanes score **75,000**, Musical Notes are **300,000 + 2%**.

**Strategy:**  
Good early-game song to line up Song Bonus in Album or Tour. Not a big scorer, but flexible with multiballs. Regular Skill Shot is preferred when starting a ball.

<a id="heading--song-hells-bells"></a>
### Hells Bells (Bell / HELL)
*(Album #6, Tour #10)*

**Opening task:** Shoot the Bell.

Bell scores **400,000 + 2%** and lights Musical Notes for the same value. Bell shots relight Musical Notes.

On the LE, VIP Passes swing the Bell and advance playfield multiplier. Mini-playfield shots score **150,000–400,000 + 2%**, freezing multiplier timer.

**Strategy:**  
One of the most valuable songs in the game, especially on the LE. Excellent with any multiball. Use VIP Passes to extend 2x/3x and inflate Song Jackpot.

<a id="heading--song-thunderstruck"></a>
### Thunderstruck (blue targets)
*(Album #11, Tour #16)*

**Opening task:** Shoot a strobing blue target.

Musical Notes are **275,000 + 2%**. Hitting blue targets builds a strobing collect shot worth **2x–5x** Musical Note value.

**Strategy:**  
Extremely strong with Super Lanes and playfield multiplier. Large collect shots can reach massive values. Best used later in the game.

<a id="heading--song-back-in-black"></a>
### Back In Black (AC/DC targets)
*(Album #6, Tour #10)*

**Opening task:** Complete AC/DC target bank.

Targets score **250,000**, bank completion scores **750,000 + 2%**, Musical Notes are **400,000 + 2%**.

**Strategy:**  
Very low value due to difficulty lighting Musical Notes. Generally one of the worst song choices.

<a id="heading--song-war-machine"></a>
### War Machine (spinner)
*(Album #14, Tour #20)*

**Opening task:** Complete a spinner level.

Spinner starts at **15,000 per spin**, increasing with shot value and spinner levels, up to **50,000 per spin**. Completing spinner levels adds **+2%** and lights Musical Notes for **350,000 + 2%**.

**Strategy:**  
One of the strongest scoring songs. Excellent for building shot value and dominating Tour Multiball. Strong loop control greatly amplifies scoring.

<a id="heading--song-for-those-about-to-rock"></a>
### For Those About To Rock (Cannon)
*(Album #7, Tour #11)*

**Opening task:** Fire the Cannon to complete lit AC/DC targets.

Cannon targets score **500,000 + 2%**, lighting doubled Musical Notes worth **700,000 + 2%**.

**Strategy:**  
Powerful scoring song that freezes timers when loading the Cannon. Excellent for extending 2x/3x and stacking with multiballs. Risky but high ceiling.

<a id="heading--song-tnt"></a>
### T.N.T. (TNT targets)
*(Album #1, Tour #3)*

**Opening task:** Complete TNT bank and standup.

Targets score **250,000**. Hurry-Ups count down from **750,000**. Musical Notes lock in Hurry-Up value and add **+2%**.

**Strategy:**  
Excellent early-game Song Bonus setup. Be careful not to waste VIP Passes before Musical Notes are lit.

<a id="heading--song-hell-aint-a-bad-place"></a>
### Hell Ain’t A Bad Place To Be (right loop / HELL)
*(Album #3, Tour #6)*

**Opening task:** Shoot right loop.

Right loop scores **250,000 + 2%**, Musical Notes are **500,000 + 2%**. Mini-playfield shots advance value and freeze multiplier timer.

**Strategy:**  
Strong early-game value builder and good Tour Multiball pairing. Solid first-song choice.

<a id="heading--song-let-there-be-rock"></a>
### Let There Be Rock (ROCK targets)
*(Album #3, Tour #5)*

**Opening task:** Hit ROCK targets four times.

Targets score **250,000**, Musical Notes are **350,000 + 2%**.

**Strategy:**  
Low-value song, but useful for early Song Bonus in Album Multiball. Mostly played for completion.

<a id="heading--all-12-songs"></a>
## Completing All 12 Songs

Once you complete a song and move on, you cannot return to it unless you complete **all 12 songs**. When all 12 songs are completed, a special wizard mode (spoiler) becomes available. After finishing it, you may select **any song again** and restart the song cycle.

<a id="heading--ranking-songs"></a>
## Ranking the Songs

This is subjective and situational, intended as a general grading of opportunity rather than absolute value.

**GREAT**
- Hells Bells  
- War Machine  

**SOLID**
- Hell Ain’t A Bad Place To Be  
- For Those About To Rock  
- Thunderstruck  

**OKAY**
- You Shook Me All Night Long  
- Highway To Hell  
- Rock N Roll Train  
- Whole Lotta Rosie  

**MEH**
- T.N.T.  

**CRUD**
- Let There Be Rock  
- Back In Black  

If unsure what to pick, choose the highest unplayed song on this list, but be ready to adapt based on multiball timing and Song Jackpot value.

<a id="heading--end-of-ball-bonus"></a>
## End Of Ball Bonus

At end of ball, bonus scoring is:

- **370** per switch hit  
- **25,000** per song lit by shots during the active song  
- **50,000** per song completed via the Jukebox  
- **50,000** per song during which all Musical Notes were collected  
- **1,000,000** if the wizard mode was played (spoiler)

The game then applies Bonus multipliers.

If Super Lanes were used to send the ball through flashing outlanes, the entire bonus can be **doubled or tripled**, accompanied by a special stamp animation.

<a id="heading--pity-points"></a>
## Pity Points

These are marginal points that generally do not affect strategy. Most values reset each ball.

- Completing AXE: **55,000 + 5,000** per completion  
- Completing a bumper level: **75,000 + 1,500** per level  
- Spinner spins: **5,000 + 1,000** per AC/DC completion + **750** per ROCK completion + **500** per TNT completion  
- Bumpers: **10,000 + 200** per bumper level  
- Red “horns”: **25,000 + 500** per horn hit  
- Completing all three horns: **100,000 + 2,000** per set  
- Unlit ramps: **25,000 + 5,000** per FIRE completion  
- Unlit loops: **50,000 + 5,000** per AXE completion  
- Slings, lanes, standups, and drops score similarly insignificant values

<a id="heading--basic-strategies"></a>
## Basic Strategies

**War Machine All Day**  
Pick *War Machine* and hammer the spinner. Shoot the right ramp from the left flipper or backhand the spinner. Start Tour Multiball whenever available.

**Jam Out**  
Pick a ramp-based song (*Rock N Roll Train*). Alternate ramps to build Combos and start Jam Multiball. During Jam, focus on ramps, Bell shots, and Musical Notes to add balls and boost multipliers.

**Hells Bells All Day**  
Pick *Hells Bells*, start any multiball, and work the Bell. Use VIP Passes to extend 2x/3x and cash Cannon shots during multipliers.

**Cannon All Day**  
Pick *For Those About To Rock*, shoot ramps to reach Jam Multiball, and fire into AC/DC targets. Stack with playfield multiplier for explosive scoring.
