## <span id="heading--gameinfo"></span>Game Information

The story of *The Mandalorian* is set after the fall of the Galactic Empire and before the emergence of the First Order. The series follows the travels of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic.

In this action-packed pinball quest, players are transported to a galaxy far, far away as they play as the Mandalorian, teaming up with key allies and protecting Grogu, while battling dangerous enemies and forces across their journey.

## <span id="heading--overview"></span>Rules Overview

- Shoot both ramps to light a Mission at the Scoop.
  - The scoop will spot ramp shots to light a Mission (only for the first 2 modes, by default)
- Shoot up the middle enough times to start a Razor Crest Multiball. If you play a multiball, you need to complete a Hunter mode to re-light the middle shot to work toward Razor Crest Hurry-Up and then your next Razor Crest Multiball. If you drain, the Razor Crest sequence will be re-enabled at the start of your next ball.
- Shoot the left ramp enough times to light and then start an Encounter, these are played on the upper playfield (Prem/LE) or upper playfield area (Pro).
- Playfield Multipliers can drastically boost the game’s scoring potential. There are 3 different +1x playfield multipliers available in the game, getting all 3 going gives a total boost of +5x playfield for a 6x playfield.
  - Hit both Boba Fett Targets to start +1x, and to add time to the playfield multiplier timer. This is the only one that can be **started** during a multiball.
  - Complete Scope to start +1x.
  - Complete Hunter to start +1x.
    - You can also spot these playfield multipliers at the Foundry by spending Beskar and (as of v1.40) from Ambush.
- You can collect Equipment to get specific perks or enable certain features by spending Beskar at the Foundry, from Scope, from Ambush, and as a Child Mystery Award.
  - Flamethrower starts lit at the beginning of a game and is used to light the main shots with a one time use 2x shot multiplier.

### <span id="heading--quickstrategy"></span>Quick Strategy Guide

- Stacking a Mission with a Razor Crest Multiball can score some quick, relatively easy, and relatively safe points.
- Getting **any** playfield multipliers going can drastically boost your scoring.
- Use the Flamethrower to double the value of your next shots, specifically when you have a single shot that is worth a lot of points (like with Jet Pack Multiball’s Super Jackpot) or when you have lots of shots lit for decent points and/or when the value of those shots builds the value of another shot (like with the other two Multiballs).
- **“The Fire Triangle”**:
  - The basic idea is to get all of your playfield multipliers going and then play a multiball. Scope needs to be completed and Hunter needs to be started, but ideally completed, before multiball starts. The Boba Fett playfield multiplier can be started after multiball starts.
  - With Ice Spider Multiball or Pirates Multiball running, once you also have all of the playfield multipliers running, activate the Flamethrower for all of the shots to make each shot worth 12x the base value for 1 shot, then back to 6x as long as you keep the timer going. This will also build your Super Jackpot value where you can score even further big points.
  - With Jetpack Multiball, the Super Jackpot is being built during the Multiball but can’t be collected until you’re back in single ball play. You want to max out the base Super Jackpot value to 50M while keeping all of your playfield multipliers active, and then use Flamethrower before collecting the Super Jackpot in single ball play for 600M.

## <span id="heading--modesofplay"></span>Modes of Play

These modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:

- **Standard:**  
  See below for full rulesheet.
- **Competition:**  
  Same as *Standard* but with elements of randomness removed and extra balls turned off. This also disables the Child mystery award.
- **Cooperation:**  
  Shared progress between 2 to 4 players.
- **Team Play:**  
  2 vs. 2 players, 3 vs. 1 player or 2 vs. 1 player.
- **Impossible Play:**  
  Game set to *Very Hard*:
  - No ball save or extra balls (cannot purchase them from the Foundry).
  - Multiballs harder to light.
  - Multiball ball save shortened.
  - Slightly less Beskar awarded.
  - Unable to purchase Armor from the Foundry.
  - ~2.5 seconds of hold time per flip before flipper releases. Hold time recharges when flippers are not flipped. Does *not* affect the mini playfield flippers. (Think: party game.)
- **Monster Play:**  
  In a multiplayer game, player one is the “Monster” and plays with *Impossible Play* rules. All other players are set to Standard Play.
- **Challenge Mode:**  
  In the Challenge mode, you directly play the the “You Have What I Want” wizard mode.
- **DJ Mixer:**  
  Typical jukebox feature as seen in most modern Sterns, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists.

## <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots

**Regular Skill Shot:** The ball falls into the CHILD top lanes area by default. A strong shot will always fall through the “C” lane, so either time your plunge accordingly or nudge the ball through either of the two cycling lit lanes. Skill shots award 1 million points (+1M per skill shot) and these awards:

- +2 Bonus X
- Light **[The Child](#heading--child)**
- +1 **[Super Pops](#heading--superpops)** bumper

**Super Skill Shot:** Hold in the left flipper until the ball passes the C lane to light the super skill shot sequence: U-Turn to right ramp to one of three final shots, within 5 seconds per shot. Each final shot gives a different award:

- Left scoop - Starts currently lit **[Mission](#heading--missions)**.
- Left ramp - Starts currently lit **[Encounter](#heading--encounters)**.
- Center ramp - Starts currently lit **[Razor Crest Multiball or Hurry-Up](#heading--razorcrest)** depending on what feature will be started next.

## <span id="heading--razorcrest"></span>Razor Crest Multiballs

The Razor Crest is the Mandalorian’s ship, which originally served as a military patrol craft prior to the rise of the Galactic Empire and helped him during his early years as a bounty hunter.

There are three Razor Crest Multiball modes that can be played throughout the game - they cannot be replayed until *This Is The Way* has been activated. These three multiball modes are started by shooting the center Razor Crest target with enough strength to register a direct hit enough times; the multiball is determined by the currently flashing numbered green insert, which is changed by hitting the “BOBA” and “FETT” standup targets when a multiball isn’t currently lit, and is started with a shot that heads all the way around the center ramp. Each successive Razor Crest feature started requires an additional target hit.

After playing a multiball, the Razor Crest can be relit to start Razor Crest Hurry-Up by completing a **[Hunter](#heading--hunter)** mode. The Razor Crest also relights when the ball drains, if it isn’t currently lit. Playing all three multiballs in a single game qualifies **[Precious Cargo](#heading--miniwizards)** as the final Razor Crest award. Every Super Jackpot scored during multiball adds 2.5 million to **[end-of-ball bonus](#heading--bonus)**.

The three multiball modes are:

- **(1) Ice Spider Multiball**: Make all of the purple shots once to kill the ice spiders and light the timed Super Jackpot at the U-Turn, which can be collected as many times as possible before the 20 seconds expire and the jackpots relight. The timer for the Super Jackpot can be increased by 5 seconds per upper playfield target.
- **(2) Jetpack Multiball**: All shots are lit purple to score jackpots and increase the Super Jackpot value; shots can’t be repeated until a different shot is made. During the jackpot phase, the left ramp will always divert balls onto the mini playfield, where shots to any of the six standup targets (now flashing purple) will score jackpots and add to the Super Jackpot value, with an add-a-ball for hitting all six targets. Super Jackpot lights at the U-Turn after multiball ends.
- **(3) Pirates Multiball**: Shoot waves of lit shots to take out pirates and score jackpots while keeping the rhydonium stable with switch hits and shots to the spinner. Each jackpot shot can only be made once per wave, and each wave requires one additional jackpot shot to complete. Complete Wave 3 to light the Super Jackpot at the U-Turn shot; after collecting the Super Jackpot, Wave 1 starts again with each jackpot now requiring two shots to each purple arrow.

### <span id="heading--razorcresthurryup"></span>Razor Crest Hurry-Up

Razor Crest Hurry-Up lights at the center ramp after the first and second Razor Crest Multiballs and is started in the same way, sharing the number of center target hits required to start it. This is a timed hurry-up mode where the player must make a certain number of shots to the Razor Crest target, collecting hurry-up values for each shot. The base hurry-up value, and the number of shots required to win the mode, increases based on the number of active **[Playfield Multipliers](#heading--pfx)** (+2 shots per multiplier). Hitting the target the required number of times or running out of time ends the mode.

## <span id="heading--missions"></span>Missions

Missions are 60-second timed, story-based modes that can be lit at the scoop by making a shot to both the left and right ramps; if a mission isn’t lit, the qualified mission can be changed by shooting either 2x target to both sides of the right ramp. After making all flashing yellow shots during a mission, typically ending with the scoop, the player will score a timer bonus worth 225,000 x the number of seconds remaining when they won the mode. Using **[Whistling Birds](#heading--equipment)** collects all of the mission’s currently lit shots.

Every completed mission adds 2.5 million to **[end-of-ball bonus](#heading--bonus)**, and playing all five missions is required to qualify **[I Like Those Odds](#heading--miniwizards)**. Once a ball drains or the timer ends, the currently active mission will end in failure and can’t be played again until **This Is The Way** has been started. Starting 2 missions lights the **[extra ball](#heading--extraballs)**.

The five missions are:

- **(1) Find the Asset**: Three shots will be flashing yellow; when any of them are made, the right ramp will light for a hurry-up lasting about 10 seconds. Making the hurry-up will then light both orbits and the left ramp (for the hurry-up value); after two shots have been made to any of the orbits or left ramp, the left scoop will light to finish the mode or you can continue to shoot the orbits and left ramp for more points.
- **(2) Deceive the Magistrate**: This is a mode in two halves, represented by yellow inserts for Mando and blue inserts for Ahsoka. For Mando, the right ramp must be made to start a hurry-up at the left ramp (with an optional bonus shot worth ? at the right orbit); for Ahsoka, the U-turn must be made, followed by the right orbit and then the U-turn again. The final shot at the left scoop will only light when both halves have been completed.
- **(3) Destroy the Imperial Base**: “Shoot all shots” affair where shots to the left spinner will increase the values of each shot made (shown by the inserts changing color from yellow to orange to red). The left scoop will finish the mode when enough shots have been made.
- **(4) Defeat the Mudhorn**: Four flashing yellow shots must be made, which are changed by the pop bumpers; if either orbit is made, the ball will be diverted into the CHILD rollover lanes and increase the value for the yellow shots. The left scoop will light to finish the mode after all four yellow shots are made, and the left and right ramp will be lit for one-time bonus shots when the scoop lights.
- **(5) Infiltrate the Freighter**: One shot to the U-turn will light both the left ramp and left orbit for a brief period of time; shooting either of those shots will light the left scoop to finish the mode. The right ramp will also light when the final shot is lit for a bonus.

## <span id="heading--encounters"></span>Encounters

Encounters are three untimed modes played on the Mando helmet-shaped mini playfield. The Pro version has a single-flipper mini playfield, Prem / LE has a tilting mini playfield with two flippers.

An Encounter can be started by shooting the left ramp until the insert in front of the left ramp changes to flashing red (1 ramp shot for the first Encounter + 2 per further Encounter started), at which point all left ramp shots will send the ball to the mini playfield for Encounter scoring. Encounters may be played during normal single-ball play or while Missions are running, but are otherwise delayed until currently active modes have been finished. The three Encounters listed on the playfield are identical in regards to rules, but use different scenes from the show and require more target hits per Encounter; all three must be completed, in order, to qualify **[You Have What I Want](#heading--miniwizards)**.

Each Encounter requires three waves of lit target hits indicated by the yellow flashing inserts on the mini-playfield, which can also be spotted by activating the **[Rising Phoenix (Pro) / Jet Pack (Prem / LE)](#heading--equipment)**. After completing the three sets of targets, a timed **Bonus Level** begins where all shots score 2 million + points for each target made during the Bonus Level, and shooting the roving purple targets adds more points to the value scored at the end of the Bonus Level. Progress towards completing Encounter levels carries over between attempts, though Bonus Level ends when either the timer expires or the ball exits the mini-playfield.

Soft plunges and orbits that enter the mini playfield start a Sneaky Encounter, with a starting value that carries over multiple entries. This encounter has a 10 second timer that resets as successful target shots are made (progressing through blue - purple - green), and when the ball exits the mini playfield.

## <span id="heading--otherfeatures"></span>Other Features

### <span id="heading--equipment"></span>Equipment

Throughout the game, the Mandalorian acquires several pieces of equipment. Only one use of each piece of equipment can be qualified at a time, and equipment can be qualified by:

- Buying it at the **[Foundry](#heading--foundry)**
- Scoring the U-Turn during **[Scope](#heading--scope)** (two random unqualified equipment)
- **[The Child’s mystery award](#heading--child)** (two random unqualified equipment)

The five pieces of equipment are:

- **Flamethrower (Orange):** As the Mandalorian’s most trustworthy weapon, one use of the Flamethrower is given at the start of every game. Hold the action button to light all main arrow shots on fire from the right to the left of the playfield; if you let go before the flames get to the left orbit, then you lose the opportunity to light those shots on fire. Your next shot to each “flaming” shot will score 2x for all associated points for that shot, and will extinguish the fire on that shot. Flaming shots can be made at any time, but disappear when the ball drains. You can also collect the Flamethrower by choosing to continue the **[Ambush](#heading--ambush)** mode twice.
- **Amban Rifle (Green):** Press the action button to add-a-ball to any multiball mode, **[Razor Crest](#heading--razorcrest)** or otherwise. The action button only lights green once the initial ball save timer has run out.
- **Whistling Birds (Yellow):** Press the action button to instantly collect all flashing shots during a **[mission](#heading--missions)**. This also collects lit jackpots during multiball modes and is affected by the Flamethrower multiplier.
- **Rising Phoenix (Pro) / Jet Pack (Premium / LE) (Red):** Press the action button to instantly complete a wave of targets during an **[Encounter](#heading--encounters)**. On the Premium / LE models, this also levels the mini playfield when used.
- **Armor:** Adds additional time to the ball save timer, both in single-ball and multiball play. This piece of equipment can only be collected once per game.

### <span id="heading--foundry"></span>Foundry & Beskar

The Foundry has many items in stock for those who have enough Beskar to pay for them, and is dedicated to helping Mandalorian warriors in battle.

Beskar can be collected through the following methods:

- Completing a **[Hunter](#heading--hunter)** mode (minimum of 250 Beskar)
- Scoring the left 2x target during **[Scope](#heading--scope)** (200 Beskar)
- **[The Child’s mystery award](#heading--child)** (300 to 400 Beskar)

Once any of the above methods have been achieved, “Foundry” will light at the left scoop to trade in the Beskar for a variety of features. Five of these items are **[equipment](#heading--equipment)**, which can also be obtained through other methods; while others can only be obtained here. Two adjacent items can be purchased during each trip to the Foundry, with a 10% discount on two-item purchases. You may also pass and save your Beskar for later.

Each time you purchase an item, that item’s cost will increase by 50% from its current cost (not the base cost). For example, the first Light Encounter is 100 Beskar, the 2nd would be 100 x 1.5 = 150, your 3rd would be 150 x 1.5 = 225, etc. Armor and Extra Ball can only be purchased once and will be replaced with ? on further visits to the Foundry.

<div class="md-table">

| Item | Description | Cost | Restrictions |
|----|----|----|----|
| **[Armor](#heading--equipment)** | Extended ball save times (including multiballs) | 200 | Max. 1 |
| **[Whistling Birds](#heading--equipment)** | One-use “smart bomb” for missions, CHILD mystery, multiballs | 175 |  |
| **[Rising Phoenix (Pro) / Jet Pack (Prem / LE)](#heading--equipment)** | Action button immediately completes current Encounter level (Prem / LE - levels mini playfield) | 175 |  |
| **[Flamethrower](#heading--equipment)** | One use of the Flamethrower at the action button | 175 |  |
| **[Amban Rifle](#heading--equipment)** | Multiball add-a-ball | 175 |  |
| **[Start Mission](#heading--missions)** | Immediately starts the currently lit mission | 175 |  |
| **[Razor Crest](#heading--razorcrest)** | Immediately lights next multiball or hurry-up | 300 |  |
| **[Light Encounter](#heading--encounters)** | Immediately lights next Encounter | 100 |  |
| **[Light Scope](#heading--scope)** | Lights left inlane for Scope | 75 |  |
| Light Heal | Lights outlane ball saver | 200 |  |
| **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)** | Lights extra ball at the left scoop | 600 | Max. 1 |
| **[Multiplier](#heading--pfx)** | +1 playfield multiplier | 500 |  |

</div>

If an item is incompatible with what you currently have (e.g. an item you already have, lighting something that’s already lit, or a purchased Extra Ball), it will be replaced with a “?” icon. This ? item always costs 100 Beskar. If you purchase the ?, the selector will rapidly flash randomly; pressing the action button will stop and win that item (ie. *Press Your Luck* but no whammies). ? can acquire items that you don’t currently have enough Beskar to buy, and if you manage to stop on a ? again, you will receive a random award from the following:

- **[Light Ambush](#heading--ambush)**
- **[Start Hunter](#heading--hunter)**
- Start **Dank Farrik!** (2-ball multiball, all switches score 10,000 + 1,000 per every switch threshold and an intergalactic curse word)
- Light all three +1x **[playfield multipliers](#heading--pfx)** (!)
- Light **[Child](#heading--child)**

If the **topper** is connected, collecting 20,000 Beskar will light the foundry for **[Beskar Bonanza](#heading--bonanza)**. Beskar collected carries over between games.

### <span id="heading--hunter"></span>Hunter

As a bounty hunter, going on hunts is one of the easiest ways to collect Beskar. Completing the left bank of standup targets at any time during normal play will light *Hunter* on one of the inlanes, which can be toggled between lit inlanes with either flipper button and can start at any time during single-ball play. Rolling through a lit inlane begins a 25-second timed Hunter mode to collect Beskar to trade at the Foundry. While your Beskar slowly builds through shots and switch hits, completing Hunter missions is one of the most lucrative sources of Beskar. Three different Hunts are available that change the displays seen during the mode.

Shoot the flashing orbit, then shoot the opposite orbit to collect a minimum of 250 Beskar and end the Hunt; the Beskar can also be built by 25 per shot by hitting the lit left or right ramp. Completing a Hunt will also start a 75-second **[playfield multiplier](#heading--pfx)** and enable the **[Razor Crest](#heading--razorcrest)** if it isn’t currently lit.

### <span id="heading--scope"></span>Scope

Another weapon built into the Mandalorian’s immense arsenal, the scope enables the Mandalorian to make precise hits on enemies from any distance. Make a shot to all three shots with blue arrow inserts (U-Turn, left 2x target, and right ramp) to light Scope at the left inlane for a 5-second timed shot with a brief grace period, with different awards available at each of the shots that were used to light Scope:

- U-Turn - 2 random pieces of **[equipment](#heading--equipment)**, or points if all equipment has already been collected.
- Left 2x target - 200 **[Beskar](#heading--foundry)**.
- Right ramp - 2 million.

Hitting any lit arrow before the timer expires collects the corresponding award and starts a 75-second **[playfield multiplier](#heading--pfx)**. All three Scope awards can only be collected once per set; once a set is complete, one of the four wizard modes must be played to re-qualify Scope.

### <span id="heading--ambush"></span>Ambush

If no other modes are running and the U-Turn (Pro) / right scoop (Prem / LE) has been shot, all six major shots might light for about 5 seconds; two out of the six shots will start Ambush, while the others will escape and score a bonus of 2 million. On competition settings, the second shot will always start the mode. After the first Ambush has been played, the number of lit shots that might start the mode will decrease to 5.

This is a unique hurry-up mode that starts with the U-turn / reverse scoop lit red to stop the value counting down on the display, and all other shots lit in white to add a few seconds of time and increase the displayed value. Shooting the U-turn / reverse scoop locks in the value, and lights all shots blue (except for the U-turn and right ramp) to add to the value further and return to the white stage to potentially increase the ambush value further again. Shooting the right ramp when all shots are lit blue will end the mode and award the value, meaning the mode can go on for as long as you like if you continuously increase the value.

Bonus awards are given out if the player pushes their luck and continues the Ambush instead of ending it:

- 2 Ambush restarts - **[Flamethrower](#heading--equipment)**
- 3, 4, 5 Ambush restarts - **[+1x Playfield](#heading--pfx)**

With all multipliers active, the max Ambush value is 720M! <a href="https://youtu.be/Ew_P40Fq4EA?t=209" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="//tiltforums.com/images/emoji/google/arrow_forward.png?v=12" title=":arrow_forward:" class="emoji only-emoji" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" alt=":arrow_forward:" /></a>

### <span id="heading--child"></span>The Child Mystery Award

Grogu, a Jedi being of the same species as Yoda, fell into the Mandalorian’s care near the beginning of his journey. Gideon and others continue attempting to reclaim their ownership of him, but the Mandalorian isn’t willing to give him up.

Qualify the CHILD mystery award by shooting either orbit once, and every two, three, etc. times thereafter. When lit, shots to the orbits will divert to the rollover lane area to collect an award based on the rollover that was made. If no rollover is made, the award lit at the “D” insert is scored; and using **[Whistling Birds](#heading--equipment)** while the five awards are lit will score them all. The display will show which award is available at which rollover.

Awards include:

- **[Equipment](#heading--equipment)**
- 300 - 400 **[Beskar](#heading--foundry)**
- **[Super Pops](#heading--superpops)**
- **Super Spinner**
- +1 **[Playfield Multiplier](#heading--pfx)**
- Light Heal
- Increase **[Ambush](#heading--ambush)** Value +2,000,000
- +1x - +3x **[Bonus Multiplier](#heading--bonus)**
- 2,500,000
- Light **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)**
- Special

### <span id="heading--pfx"></span>Playfield Multipliers

Three “+1x” multiplier inserts with colored rings are seen above the right slingshot. Each insert lit adds +1x to playfield scoring when running. Lighting all three will instead award +5x for a total of 6x. Multipliers start automatically when earned and share the same timer.

Completing **[This Is The Way](#heading--wizard)** and earning your Signet will add +1x playfield multiplier for the remainder of the game. A 75-second playfield multiplier (either Hunter or Scope) can also be started from selecting it in the **[Foundry](#heading--foundry)**, and by making enough restart shots during **[Ambush](#heading--ambush)**.

The multiplier inserts blink purple when active, and strobe between blue / purple when the timer is close to expiring.

- Orange - 75 seconds. Awarded by successfully completing a **[Hunter](#heading--hunter)** mode.
- Blue - 75 seconds. Awarded by successfully completing a **[Scope](#heading--scope)** shot.
- Green - 30 seconds. Awarded by hitting the two green Boba Fett targets. Subsequent multipliers require more hits to start, and the timer will start 10 seconds lower if started again on the same ball (minimum of 10 seconds).

### <span id="heading--superpops"></span>Super Pops & Super Spinner

One of the two bumpers towards the bottom of the CHILD lanes can be lit for 50,000 points each by spelling CHILD, or from the skill shot. **[CHILD mystery award](#heading--child)** may also light both bumpers for super pops.

Super spinner is started upon collecting 100 spinner hits on a single ball, or from the mystery award. Every spinner hit for the remainder of the ball scores 50,000 points, increasing by 10,000 per left orbit shot to a maximum of 100,000.

### <span id="heading--extraballs"></span>Extra Balls

Lit extra balls can be collected at the left scoop, and can be lit by:

- Starting 2 **[Missions](#heading--missions)**
- Purchasing one at the **[Foundry](#heading--foundry)** for 600 Beskar (one time only)
- **[The Child’s mystery award](#heading--child)**

### <span id="heading--bonus"></span>End-of-Ball Bonus

End of ball bonus is determined by:

- Switch bonus
- 2.5 million per **[Super Jackpot](#heading--razorcrest)** scored
- 2.5 million per **[Mission](#heading--missions)** completed

multiplied by the bonus multiplier, which increases by +1x by completing CHILD and also increases by +2x from a successful **[skill shot](#heading--skillshots)**. Switch bonus resets between balls.

## <span id="heading--topper"></span>Topper Exclusive Modes

Two features can only be accessed if The Mandalorian topper is installed. One of these features resets at the start of each game, while the other retains progress across games.

### <span id="heading--madness"></span>Mandalorian Madness

Fill out the grid on the left side of the topper by:

- Winning a **[Mission](#heading--missions)**
- Scoring a Super Jackpot during any **[Razor Crest Multiball](#heading--razorcrest)**
- Completing an **[Encounter](#heading--encounters)**
- Collecting a **[Scope](#heading--scope)** award
- Completing a **[Hunter](#heading--hunter)** mode
- Cashing out the value during an **[Ambush](#heading--ambush)**

Once all six icons are solidly lit, and no other modes are running, the next shot to the Razor Crest will start Mandalorian Madness.

Mandalorian Madness starts out as a timed single-ball mode but can turn into a 4-ball multiball by cashing out super jackpots during the mode. All the shots that helped you get to Mandalorian Madness are lit during this mode, and completing any of the sets listed below lights the U-turn for super jackpot:

- All 3 Mission shots (eject, left ramp, right ramp)
- Two of the Scope shots (either U-turn, left 2x, or right ramp)
- Both Hunter shots (left orbit and right orbit)
- Ambush shot (right ramp)

If “Mission” isn’t lit at the left ramp, shooting it will send the ball to the Encounter playfield. Complete all six targets there to add +1x to the **[playfield multiplier](#heading--pfx)**.

Super Jackpots increase in value when stacked, and each Super Jackpot adds a ball. The multiball ends when time runs out.

### <span id="heading--bonanza"></span>Beskar Bonanza

The right side of the topper has a meter dedicated to the **[Beskar](#heading--foundry)** players collect during the game. Once any player has gotten the meter to 20,000 Beskar, the next shot to the Foundry will instantly award one of *every* item in the Foundry, meaning:

- All **[equipment](#heading--equipment)**
- Starting the currently lit **[mission](#heading--missions)**
- Qualifying the next **[Razor Crest multiball or hurry-up](#heading--razorcrest)**
- Lighting the next **[Encounter](#heading--encounters)**
- Lighting **[Scope](#heading--scope)**
- Lighting **Heal** (outlane ball save)
- Lighting **[extra ball](#heading--extraballs)**
- **[+1x Playfield](#heading--pfx)**

Once Beskar Bonanza has been scored, the Beskar meter resets to 0.

## <span id="heading--miniwizards"></span>Mini-Wizard Modes

To access **[This Is The Way](#heading--wizard)**, three mini-wizard modes must be started, corresponding to the three sets of inserts listed above the flippers. These mini-wizard modes are:

### <span id="heading--cargo"></span>Precious Cargo

Play all 3 **[Razor Crest Multiballs](#heading--razorcrest)** once, then shoot the Razor Crest enough times to start this mini-wizard mode. (need more info)

### <span id="heading--odds"></span>I Like Those Odds

Play all 5 **[Missions](#heading--missions)** once, then this mini-wizard mode will start as the 6th mission. This wizard mode is split into three phases:

- Shoot both ramps and the Razor Crest once each. Shoot the scoop to finish the phase.
- Shoot the above shots again, along with the U-turn. Shoot the scoop to finish the phase.
- 4-ball multiball then begins. Make every major shot to win the mode and start a wizard frenzy for 60 seconds (every switch scores 250,000 points).

### <span id="heading--want"></span>You Have What I Want

Play all 3 **[Encounters](#heading--encounters)** once, then shoot the left ramp 7 times to start this mini-wizard mode. (need more info)

## <span id="heading--wizard"></span>This Is The Way

Play all three of the **[mini-wizard modes](#heading--miniwizards)**, then make all six major lit shots followed by the left scoop, to start *This Is The Way* and attempt to earn your Signet.

This mode consists of three rounds, each of which alternates between a single-ball phase and *Multiball Bonus Round*. The single-ball phases start with a ball saver, where you must make 5 shots to qualify the scoop, left ramp, or center shot to start the multiball phase. The first round will have three shot choices per shot, the second will have two, and the third will have one.

The faster you complete the single-ball phase, the more time you will get for the multiball phase. All regular playfield shots score jackpots, and the mini-playfield scores its own jackpots. Completing the mini playfield increases the multiplier.

After completing three rounds of both phases, you will be awarded 10 million and your Signet. All missions, multiballs, and encounters will reset, and you will be awarded an additional **[playfield multiplier](#heading--pfx)** for the rest of the game.
