***The Uncanny X-Men*** is Jack Danger’s third retail pinball machine (second cornerstone game) following 2023’s *Foo Fighters* and was similarly designed from the ground up as an evolution of prior pinball machines. The machine is based on the “Days of Future Past” story arc from the comics. Players will complete missions and objectives to enable Cerebro for time travel, allowing them to save the future by changing the past.

## <span id="heading--overview"></span>Rules Overview:

- Shoot the white shots to light **missions** at the “midtown” center ramp or “subway” right loop. Use the flippers and action button to select a mission.
  - Every time a mission is completed, the player will travel in time to the future. Defeat 6 sentinels at the flashing shots, then shoot the center ramp to return to the past.
  - “Challenging” missions have a different future mode called **Escape Nimrod**. Make any red shot 3 times then shoot the center ramp or right loop to complete.
  - Escaping the future awards a perk; a different perk for every mission completed!
- Hit the giant Sentinel head enough times to spawn the giant sentinel, then start **Sentinel Multiball** by defeating it. Shoot jackpots to enable sentinel kills and light the super jackpot at the giant head. The danger room ramp relights all jackpot shots and increases their multiplier.
- Complete three shots to every ramp and orbit on the playfield to light **Save the City** multiball at the center ramp (lit yellow). Hit the standup targets, spinner, and bumpers to light the ramps and orbits for jackpots.
- Light Cerebro by collecting sets of purple standup targets, then advance the rule by hitting any ramp that feeds the post. **To Me, My X-Men** multiball starts after advancing Cerebro three times. Shoot blue shots for jackpots and the uptown or danger room ramp when lit red for super jackpots.
- Defeat 35 Sentinels during **sentinel multiball** or **the future** to light the left ramp for **Berzerker** multiball. Shoot 5 yellow shots to score jackpots. Score super jackpots by shooting the X-jet followed by the exit ramp for a 2x super jackpot.
- Complete training in the **Danger Room** by hitting the spinner, targets, bumper, and ramp during single-ball, non-mode play. The first level doubles all scoring during modes, and the second & third levels make the future easier to complete & more valuable. Each danger room level also increases multiball scoring.
- Hit **Bishop**’s bumper enough times to qualify the action button, then press the action button during a mode to spot the most valuable shot.
- Shoot **Beast’s Lab** to collect mystery awards based on the level of the award (increased by hitting ramps prior to the target).
- Hit **Gambit**’s bumper three times, or hit it with an alley pass to the right inlane, to increase the next mode’s shot value to 2x.

## <span id="heading--layout"></span>Layout:

## <span id="heading--modesofplay"></span>Modes of Play:

These modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:

- **Standard:**

See below for full rulesheet.

- **Competition:**

- **DJ Mixer**

NOT a gameplay mode. This mode operates like a jukebox, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists.

- **Competition Install**

Not from the gameplay menu, but the following is changed if a Competition Install is performed from the utilities menu:

- Extra balls are disabled (first level 3 Beast’s Lab award will always qualify Beast for use in the future)

## <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots:

There are four skill shots available at the start of each ball:

- Soft plunge into the lane near the highway ramp entrance for 200k & +1 **[bonus X](#heading--bonus)**.
- Hit the X-Jet shot to feed the X-Mansion ramp for +3 bonus X. If the ball enters the ramp, the danger room exit ramp can then be hit for a super skill shot.
- Hit the downtown shot repeatedly for up to a 5-way time loop combo. If all 5 shots were made, the left ramp can be hit for the final shot in the sequence, which adds +15 seconds to the initial ball save timer.
- Hit the left ramp for a Cerebro skill shot. This spots one shot’s worth of progress towards **[To Me, My X-Men](#heading--xavier)** multiball.

## <span id="heading--missions"></span>Missions:

Hit the lit white shots, then hit any blue shot to start the next mission - the first one lights after just one white shot, but more are needed for every mission completed. Missions can be started at any ramp with a blue arrow: either the midtown center ramp or subway right loop. The corner four missions are easier to complete than the four in between them.

Completing any mission will start **[the future](#heading--future)**, so long as any **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** mode isn’t running; if one is, the center ramp will light after the stack to start the future instead. Defeating 6 Sentinels during this timed challenge lights the center ramp to return to the past and award a perk unique to the X-Men member that the mode focused on, active during both past and future gameplay modes. The respective X-Men members are listed next to each mission name.

Before starting a mission, getting the **[danger room](#heading--danger)** to level 1 (green) will double all mission scoring. The danger room progress carries over from ball to ball until level 1 is reached.

**[Extra ball](#heading--extraballs)** is lit at the right inlane after 3 missions, then 7 missions, have been completed. These extra balls are only lit the first time through the modes.

Modes are listed clockwise.

**Tier 1s / Easy Missions**:

- **Rescue the Innocent** (*Bishop*): 6 red shots to rescue each innocent citizen - they light in an order that allows combos to be made. Bishop pop bumper increases the multiplier for each shot up to 5x. Perfect - score at least one shot worth 5x.
- **Bitter Rivalry** (*Wolverine*): 4 random shots are lit, 3 yellow and 1 blue. Hit four shots to defeat Sabretooth. Blue shots score more. The lit shots are reshuffled after each shot made. Perfect - hit nothing but blue shots.
- **Smuggled Cargo** (*Gambit*): 7 blue shots to recover the cargo. Blinking purple arrows score double damage & progress (they move from left to right) and right bumper adds 200k to the next shot award. Perfect - hit nothing but purple shots (5 shots to finish total).
- **Stopping a Juggernaut** (*Professor X*): Alternate between red shots and targets (X-Jet orbit, Beast’s lab, X-Mansion ball save target) to defeat Juggernaut. Five shots are required to complete the mode. Perfect - complete the mode with more than 25 seconds remaining.

**Tier 2s / Challenging Missions**:

- **Sentinel Facility Raid** (*Rogue*): Shots move from left to right. Make a shot to defeat the moving Sentinels on the assembly line and destroy 1 **sentinel** towards lighting **[berzerker multiball](#heading--berzerker)**. Sentinel target hits stop them from moving for a few seconds, and 8 shots will complete the mode. Perfect - hit nothing but the farthest lit shots (to the left) in the wave (?)
- **A Fiery Assault** (*Storm*): All shots are initially lit red. Shoot a red shot to extinguish Pyro’s flames and turn the shot blue. Shoot a blue shot to damage him and unlight the shot. 3 blue shots to finish. Perfect - collect all red shots before collecting 3 blue shots.
- **Mayhem in Midtown** (*Colossus*): Hit the targets in between shots to light the two shots flanking the target yellow. Hitting the targets enough times lights red shots for 2x progression. 5 yellow shots to complete. Perfect - light all shots red and collect at least one red shot at each set.
- **Genosha Under Siege** (*Magneto*): Red shots defeat Magneto, and green shots defeat Toad for bonus scores (but move to a different shot every 5 seconds or when a bumper is hit). Green shots are worth 2x red shots. Perfect - hit nothing but green shots.

## <span id="heading--future"></span>The Future & X-Men Perks:

The Future is a 40-second timed mode with ball save lasting for its first 10 seconds, which starts when any **[easy mission](#heading--missions)** has been completed and the player isn’t in a **[multiball mode](#heading--multiballs)**. If the player has completed a mode while in a multiball, the center ramp will light to start The Future. The game will always attempt to hold the ball when The Future starts.

In the future, **Sentinels** have taken over and other modes cannot be started. The player must destroy the Sentinels by shooting the shots they have spawned in front of; shots to the giant sentinel head increase the value for defeating each individual sentinel (in the order white - green - yellow - red, +1x per color change). Each Sentinel occupies 1 shot, and once defeated, another shot must be made to relight the previously destroyed Sentinel. Destroying 35 Sentinels over the course of the game will light the uptown ramp to start **[berzerker multiball](#heading--berzerker)**.

Once 6 sentinels have been defeated, the midtown (center) and subway (right loop) ramps will light to escape the future and award whatever **perk** was qualified from completing a mission in the past before returning there. If the player runs out of time, fails to defeat enough sentinels, or fails to escape, the player will return to the past without the perk being awarded.

Before starting the future, getting the **[danger room](#heading--danger)** to level 2 or 3 will help with the mode. Level 2 (yellow) makes the mode require one less sentinel to defeat before lighting the center ramp to escape. Level 3 (red) will make all sentinels count double, rewarding 2x their corresponding value and 2 sentinels towards lighting the escape.

The **perks** are dependent on what mission was completed prior to starting The Future. There are also four perks earned through other methods besides completing missions, and are awarded instantly without having to complete The Future.

<div class="md-table">

| **Member** | **Requirement** | **Perk Description** |
|----|----|----|
| **Beast** | Advance **[Beast’s Lab](#heading--beast)** to level 3 | Beast’s Lab awards can now be earned in the future. |
| **Bishop** | Complete **[Rescue the Innocent](#heading--missions)** and escape **the future** | Less left bumper hits are required to light **[Bishop](#heading--bishop)** uses. |
| **Cyclops** | Complete 3 **[Danger Room](#heading--danger)** levels in one game | Increases the **[combo](#heading--combos)** timers. |
| **Gambit** | Complete **[Smuggled Cargo](#heading--missions)** and escape **the future** | Hitting the lit **[Gambit bumper](#heading--gambit)** now multiplies the next shot by 3x rather than 2x. |
| **Jean Grey** | 10 **[X-Mansion ball save](#heading--outlaneballsave)** target hits | Right outlane ball save rule can be advanced during the future. The next level 2 **[Beast’s lab award](#heading--beast)** will always be “Light X-Mansion Ball Save”. |
| **Nightcrawler** | Hit purple Nightcrawler targets 20 times | Purple targets now count towards destroying Sentinels in the future. |
| **Professor X** | Complete **[Stopping a Juggernaut](#heading--missions)** and escape **the future** | The **[danger room](#heading--danger)** can now be advanced and affects scoring in the future. A ball save is now given for entering the danger room once per ball. |
| **Wolverine** | Complete **[Bitter Rivalry](#heading--missions)** and escape **the future** | All ball save timers during single-ball play, past and future, are extended. First shot to a Sentinel during **[Sentinel Multiball](#heading--sentinel)** deals bonus damage. |

</div>

### <span id="heading--nimrod"></span>Escape Nimrod:

Escape Nimrod is a 35-second timed mode with ball save lasting for its first 10 seconds, which starts when any **[challenging mission](#heading--missions)** has been completed and the player isn’t in a **[multiball mode](#heading--multiballs)**. If the player has completed a mode while in a multiball, the center ramp will light to start Escape Nimrod. The game will always attempt to hold the ball when Escape Nimrod starts. **[Bishop](#heading--bishop)**’s action button rule is disabled during Escape Nimrod.

Nimrod is the most technologically advanced Sentinel out there and is incapable of being defeated via normal means. The only option is to escape by shooting one red shot within each set of three. Each red shot made scores a bonus based on the time remaining during the mode. After making 3 red shots, the center ramp and subway ramp will light on a new 10-second timer to complete the mode, defeat 4 **[sentinels](#heading--berserker)**, and award whatever **perk** was qualified from completing a mission in the past before returning there. If the player runs out of time or drains, the player will return to the past without the perk being awarded.

The **perks** are dependent on what mission was completed prior to starting Escape Nimrod.

<div class="md-table">

| **Member** | **Requirement** | **Perk Description** |
|----|----|----|
| **Colossus** | Complete **[Mayhem in Midtown](#heading--missions)** and **escape Nimrod** | All **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** ball saves are extended. |
| **Magneto** | Complete **[Genosha Under Siege](#heading--missions)** and **escape Nimrod** | All game timers are extended by +10 seconds. |
| **Rogue** | Complete **[Sentinel Facility Raid](#heading--missions)** and **escape Nimrod** | **Add-a-ball** is available by holding the action button during any **[multiball mode](#heading--multiballs)**, once per ball. Danger room spinner pauses timer for 7 seconds during Escape Nimrod. |
| **Storm** | Complete **[A Fiery Assault](#heading--missions)** and **escape Nimrod** | Bonus damage to all other Sentinels is now dealt with each lit sentinel shot during **[Sentinel Multiball](#heading--sentinel)**. Sentinel Multiball will be extended the next time it is played. |

</div>

## <span id="heading--multiballs"></span>Multiballs:

Multiballs can be stacked with any **[mission](#heading--missions)** if the mission is started before the multiball. Multiballs cannot be stacked on top of other multiballs, however, and **[berserker multiball](#heading--berserker)** takes priority over all other game features.

Completing **Sentinel Facility Raid** and then escaping **the future** will award an add-a-ball that can be used once per multiball by holding the action button while flashing green.

Colossus’ **[perk](#heading--future)**, awarded after completing **Mayhem in Midtown** and escaping **the future**, will increase the ball saves for all multiballs for the remainder of the game.

Leveling up the **[danger room](#heading--danger)** before or during any multiball (without a mode currently active) will increase the scores given to every jackpot & super jackpot award.

### <span id="heading--sentinel"></span>Sentinel Multiball:

Hit the giant sentinel 3 times (+2 per multi) to spawn it. While the giant sentinel is active, decrease its integrity with more direct hits to it. Eventually, it’s mouth will open up; defeat the giant sentinel by hitting it enough times to start the multiball. Making a **[Fastball Special](#heading--fastball)** combo will advance the Sentinel to its next stage immediately.

During the multiball, all major shots start lit to score jackpots at 1x value (lit yellow). The jackpots can be relit at an increased multiplier by shooting the **danger room** exit ramp (orange for 2x, and red for 3x); and if a shot isn’t lit for jackpot, it will instead kill 1 **sentinel** towards lighting **[berzerker multiball](#heading--berzerker)**.

After four jackpots have been scored, the super jackpot, worth the total of all jackpots collected during the previous wave, can be scored at the sentinel head (multiplied by 2x with a shot to the open mouth). The super jackpot value resets once scored and more jackpots are required to light subsequent super jackpots, to a maximum of six.

Two **[perks](#heading--missions)** help with scoring during this multiball:

- *Storm* (after completing **A Fiery Assault** and escaping **Nimrod**) will deal bonus damage to sentinels and make the jackpot easier to light. She will also extend the multiball one-time only.
- *Wolverine* (after completing **Bitter Rivalry** and escaping **the future**) will deal bonus damage to the first sentinel hit during sentinel multiball.

### <span id="heading--city"></span>Save the City Multiball:

The playfield’s six shots all have a unique “level” that are advanced by hitting them multiple times. They reach the first level with three shots, and as soon as all shots reach the same level, the midtown (center) and subway (right loop) ramps will be lit to start Save the City.

There are five areas of the city that can be lit for jackpot (7M + the shot value from their current level + any increases from qualifying shots) via enough hits to their corresponding shots, listed in the UI:

- Downtown (left) loop - loops (X-jet and left loop)
- Uptown (left) ramp - ramps (left ramp, center ramp, right loop, and right ramp)
- Midtown (center) ramp - targets (danger room, Nightcrawler, and ball save targets)
- Subway (right) loop - spinner (in the danger room)
- Highway (right) ramp - bumpers (bishop / gambit bumpers)

Each hit to the corresponding targets listed above increases the jackpot value scored at their respective shot, if their jackpot is already lit.

Once all five jackpots have been scored, the X-Jet ramp will be lit. Shoot the ramp to light the danger room spinner for a super jackpot, worth 1M for every spin of the spinner. 15 seconds are given to score as many spinner rips as possible before the process of lighting and scoring jackpots resets, with bounces into Kitty Pryde’s lane adding +10 seconds to the super jackpot timer.

Jackpots can only be earned at each shot once until a super jackpot is scored.

### <span id="heading--xavier"></span>To Me, My X-Men Multiball:

Make **[Cerebro skill shots](#heading--skillshots)**, or hit the Nightcrawler targets 5 times to light Cerebro manually, to advance towards this multiball. To Me, My X-Men starts when Cerebro has been lit and collected three times by shooting either the uptown ramp or highway ramp when Cerebro is lit.

Hit six blue lit shots to “summon” random X-Men and score jackpots. The same shot cannot be hit more than one time in a row. Every sixth jackpot lights a super jackpot at the left ramp worth the jackpot total (minimum value = about 5M), and a 2x super jackpot that can be earned at the danger room exit ramp. There is a bonus for summoning all 12 X-Men before scoring a super jackpot.

### <span id="heading--berserker"></span>Berserker Multiball:

This multiball lights at the uptown ramp after 35 **Sentinels** have been defeated and no other modes or multiballs are active. Sentinels are accumulated over the course of the game and can be earned in various ways:

- During the **[Sentinel Facility Raid](#heading--missions)** mission, each shot destroys a sentinel, up to a maximum of 7 sentinels from this mission
- During **[the future](#heading--future)**, all lit shots defeat sentinels, 2 sentinels if **[danger room](#heading--danger)** was advanced to level 3 before completing the prior mode
- During **[Escape Nimrod](#heading--nimrod)**, successfully escaping Nimrod destroys 4 sentinels
- Hitting a shot in **[sentinel multiball](#heading--sentinel)** if a jackpot has already been scored there will destroy 1 sentinel, which relights when the jackpots are relit

Berserker multiball is a 3-ball multiball where all major shots (including the sentinel head) are lit yellow to score jackpots starting at 5M per shot. Jackpot shots can’t be repeated until another one is made. After hitting 5 jackpots, shooting the X-Jet ramp will score a super jackpot worth the total of the 5 jackpots collected prior, increase the jackpot by 1M, and briefly light the danger room exit ramp to score a 2x super jackpot. Subsequent super jackpots require one more jackpot to light than before and are more valuable in turn.

## <span id="heading--otherscoring"></span>Other Scoring:

### <span id="heading--danger"></span>Danger Room:

The danger room is accessed by hitting the X-Jet shot to feed it, or the ball can fall into it on its own. Exiting the danger room via the ramp also counts as a **[Cerebro](#heading--xavier)** shot (when lit).

Level up the danger room by hitting the various features down there: the spinner, targets, ramp, and bumper. Every shot made increases the progress bar at the top of the display and eventually maxes it out, advancing a level and increasing the scoring for each **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** accordingly. The danger room level resets after each mission played, and each level gives the following perks:

- Level 1 (green): All shot values during the next **[mission](#heading--missions)** are doubled.
- Level 2 (yellow): One less sentinel is required to light the escape shot during **[the future](#heading--future)**.
- Level 3 (red): Doubles the sentinels killed and their corresponding awards during **the future**.

After completing 3 danger room levels over the course of the game, Cyclops will join the fight and increase all **[combo timers](#heading--combos)** for the rest of the game.

During missions, the danger room cannot be leveled up. Instead, it will increase the danger room bonus, which is added to the mission total alongside the final shot of a mission or future mode. 10% of the total danger room bonus is scored during **[end-of-ball bonus](#heading--bonus)** and is subject to the bonus multiplier.

“Abort” save is lit at the start of the game and can also be earned by hitting the X-Jet shot to access the danger room enough times - the first save lights after three shots. Hitting the “abort” target activates a ball save that saves any balls draining from the danger room or the main playfield for 5 seconds.

The danger room is normally disabled during **the future**, and during **[save the city multiball](#heading--city)**. By completing **Stopping a Juggernaut** and escaping **the future**, however, Xavier’s **perk** will allow the danger room bonus rule to remain active during the future. Xavier will also give the player a ball save the first time they enter the danger room each ball.

### <span id="heading--bishop"></span>Bishop (Action Button):

Hitting the left pop bumper enough times will build up Bishop’s power and up to three Bishop uses can be stacked at a time. When the action button is flashing red, press it to spot the most valuable shot lit on the playfield! *Note: Bishop will never spot the Sentinel shot or any danger room shot, and is disabled during **[Escape Nimrod](#heading--nimrod)**.*

If the **[Rescue the Innocent](#heading--missions)** mission has been completed, Bishop’s perk will reduce the number of bumper hits required to light the action button.

During all **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** modes, the number of bumper hits required to advance Bishop are doubled, unless the above perk has been scored in which case they act as normal.

### <span id="heading--pryde"></span>Kitty Pryde:

There is a hidden lane below the entrance to the downtown ramp. Shots to this lane that fall in accidentally score a value that starts at 500k and increase by 250k with each shot to the target gating it.

During **[missions](#heading--missions)**, this lane spots the leftmost lit shot on the playfield when hit, for half of the normal shot value. It will not spot shots if the final shot of a mission is lit.

### <span id="heading--combos"></span>Combos & Sentinel Attacks:

Shoot lit “X” shots in succession to score combos. The combo value starts at 200k and increases by 200k per combo to a max of 1M per shot. Lit combo shots alternate between the different shots on the playfield to prevent repeatedly shooting the center ramp. Combos increase the level of the next **[Beast’s Lab](#heading--beast)** award.

After completing 3 **[danger room](#heading--danger)** levels over the course of the game, Cyclops’ **perk** will activate and increase the combo timers.

After 6 combos have been scored, the uptown (left), midtown (center), and highway (right) ramps will light to start a **Sentinel Attack**. This feature can also be started at any shot that feeds the Sentinel hands on Prem / LE. Two red shots - any of the left ramp, center ramp, and right loop - will light to defeat 1 sentinel each and score a hurry-up value starting at 20M and quickly decreasing to 1M, with the second shot starting at 1.5x the value of the first. Every successful round of Sentinel Attack will increase the base value of the next round by +5M. No other modes can be advanced while sentinel attacks are running.

More and more combos are required to light subsequent Sentinel Attacks: 8 combos for the second then it lights at every subsequent 10 combos.

### <span id="heading--beast"></span>Beast's Lab:

Hit the captive ball in Beast’s Lab with enough strength to collect a context-sensitive award based on its current level (increased by completing combos.) It can:

- Level 1:
  - Add 200k to skill shot value
  - Double next progress shot
  - Bonus multiplier +1x
  - Danger room bonus total: 500
  - Sneak-in bonus total (50k x sneak-ins this ball)
  - 550k
- Level 2:
  - Light **[X-Mansion ball save](#heading--outlaneballsave)**
  - 5.5M
- Level 3:
  - **[Light extra ball](#heading--extraballs)** (always the first level 3 award)
  - Qualify Beast for use in **[the future](#heading--future)** (always the second level 3 award)
  - 10M

Beast’s Lab is disabled in **[the future](#heading--future)** unless Beast’s perk has been qualified via scoring a level 3 Beast’s Lab award.

### <span id="heading--gambit"></span>Gambit:

Hit Gambit’s bumper three times to increase the value of the next mode or multiball shot to 2x. Shatzing / alley passing the bumper immediately increases the next mode shot’s value to 2x.

If Gambit’s **[perk](#heading--future)** has been qualified, the shot multiplier will be increased to 3x!

### <span id="heading--fastball"></span>Fastball Special:

This 2-shot combo sequence is lit at the right inlane after completing enough sets of standup targets.

When active, a ball return to the right inlane lights a strobing shot up the left ramp. Collect for 500k, ball returns to left flipper then combo into the Sentinel to score 2.5M. Completing the Fastball Special combo will also advance to the next phase of defeating the Sentinel to start **[Sentinel Multiball](#heading--sentinel)**; for instance, if the Sentinel has spawned but its mouth isn’t open yet, making a Fastball Special will instantly advance to that phase.

### <span id="heading--outlaneballsave"></span>X-Mansion Ball Save:

Shoot the X-Mansion target (located above the Gambit pop) 4 times to light the right outlane ball save and make progress towards qualifying Jean Grey for use in **[the future](#heading--future)**.

The X-Mansion ball save cannot be advanced or qualified in the future unless Jean Grey has been qualified with enough shots to the target that lights the outlane ball save.

### <span id="heading--extraballs"></span>Extra Balls:

Light extra ball at the right inlane by:

- Completing 3, then 7 **[missions](#heading--missions)** (only for the first mission cycle)
- Scoring the first **[level 3 Beast’s Lab award](#heading--beast)**

### <span id="heading--bonus"></span>End-of-Ball Bonus:

Bonus is determined by:

- Starting bonus
- 125k x X-Mansion Ramps
- 250k x Kitty Pryde Lanes
- Danger Room Total
- 100k x Sentinels Destroyed

All multiplied by bonus X, which is built up by completing the Cerebro Bonus Build targets, near the left flipper

Bonus can be held by hitting the “bonus hold” target directly below the danger room’s mini-flipper, though it cannot be hit intentionally. If bonus is held on the last ball, it will instead be doubled.

## <span id="heading--wizard"></span>Wizard Modes:

### <span id="heading--senator"></span>Save Senator Kelly (Mini-Wizard Mode):

Light the center ramp and subway ramp to start this mode after completing all 8 **[missions](#heading--missions)**.

Save the Senator from Mystique with the help of Cerebro. This single-ball mini-wizard mode starts with 40 seconds of ball save and 2 green shots lit. Hitting both green shots will light all three Cerebro shots (uptown, highway, and danger room exit ramps) to advance to the next phase. 3 yellow shots are lit in the second phase, and 4 orange shots are lit during the third phase. During the final phase, all six major shots are lit red and a 60-second timer starts; the player must clear the six shots and shoot Cerebro before time runs out to capture Mystique and complete the mode.

**[Combos](#heading--combos)** play a vital role in this mode’s scoring. The highest combo multiplier obtained during the mode multiplies the rest of the scoring by the number of the multiplier (for instance, if a 4-way combo was made, all scoring would be multiplied by 4x for the remainder of the mode). Combos don’t advance towards other objectives during this mode.
