*Avengers: Infinity Quest* is a 2020 release from Stern Pinball, and the third design by professional pinball player Keith Elwin. The Black Order has successfully retrieved the six Infinity Gems and given them to their master, Thanos. The Avengers set out to travel back in time through one of Doctor Strange’s portals and take the Gems before the Order can, to nullify the effects of Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet and save the world.

## <span id="heading--overview"></span>Rules Overview:

- Shoot the disc to spell STRANGE, then shoot the right ramp to begin a Gem Quest. After shooting the flashing shots to win the Gem Quest, shoot the right ramp again to collect the Gem, then shoot any lit shot to place it there and enable each gem’s unique perk.
- Score combos to enable Portal Locks at the disc to multiply Gem Quest scoring.
- Assemble the Avengers and level them up, improving scoring and gem perks, by shooting their corresponding shots enough times. After collecting all six, shoot the right ramp to begin a mini-wizard mode.
- Play all three mini-wizard modes and all six Gem Quests for a chance to defeat Thanos.
- Start Iron Man Multiball by spelling IRON at the return lanes, which alternate with every spin of the disc, then locking balls at the Tower.
- Start Thor Multiball by spelling THOR at the captive ball enough times, then shooting it again.
- Complete lines of awards on the computer grid by completing the drop targets to start Super Modes.

### <span id="heading--strategy"></span>Strategy:

- Make four combos to light the disc for Portal Lock early on. This doubles all gem quest scoring and enables multiball for the mode.
- Thor Multiball is attainable with three shots to the captive ball and is always open at the start of the game. Try bringing it into your first gem quest.
- Filling out the six inserts above the flippers qualifies Soul Gem. This is also best done during multiball.
- Which gem is the best gem depends on your play style and current objectives. Figure out what works best for you and pay attention to the gem information on the display.
- Take locks for Iron Man Multiball & Hawkeye Challenge at the Tower whenever they present themselves. Intentionally trying to light them can be risky.

</div>

## <span id="heading--modesofplay"></span>Modes of Play:

These modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:

- **Standard:**  
  See below for full rulesheet.
- **Competition:**  
  Same as *Standard* but with elements of randomness removed.
- **Challenge:**  
  In this challenge mode you play an easier, modified version of the **Black Order Battle Royale** mode.
- **DJ Mixer**  
  NOT a gameplay mode. This mode operates like a Jukebox, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists (All songs, Infinity Gauntlet, Wizard Favorites).

## <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots:

All Skill Shots award points and additional ball-save time. Super & Secret Skill Shots have associated perks.

- **Skill Shot:** Plunge the ball softly into the top rollover near the pop bumpers to score the skill shot, worth 250k + 100k per successful skill shot + 3 seconds of ball save.
- **Super Skill Shot:** Full plunge then shoot the Avengers Tower for 1m + 150k per successful skill shot + 5 seconds of ball save. The first super skill shot during a game lights **[Mystery](#heading--mystery)**.
- **Secret Skill Shot 1:** Plunge the ball with medium strength such that it rolls backward down the upper loop. Worth 3m + 200k per successful skill shot + 10 seconds of ball save + instantly lights one **[Portal Lock](#heading--portalvictory)**.
- **Secret Skill Shot 2:** Full plunge and shoot the center drop target to collect 3m + 200k per skill shot + 10 seconds of ball save + the currently flashing **[grid square](#computergrid)**.

## <span id="heading--gemquests"></span>Gem Quests:

To start a Gem Quest, spin the **disc** to spell S-T-R-A-N-G-E and then shoot the right ramp (Pro) or the portal (Prem / LE) to start a Gem Quest. Hitting the disc after rolling through the right inlane will start the Eye of Agamotto insert flashing and cause each spin to advance STRANGE by 2x. Subsequent Quests require more spins to light STRANGE letters.

Select any Gem Quest you want by using the flipper buttons, and press the action button or both flippers at once to confirm your choice. Gem Quests are entirely untimed (outside of the health bar which steadily decreases over time), and only end if you drain while one is active. If you fail the Quest, Thanos gets the Gem, and this will be indicated on the display. You can re-acquire a lost Gem by completing **[Hawkeye Challenge](#heading--hawkeyechallenge)** on Marksman difficulty, and can replay Quests for Gems you’ve lost if you possess the **[Soul Gem](#heading--soulgemquest)**, although if you fail a replayed Quest, you will also lose the Soul Gem.

Either **[Multiball](#heading--multiball)** and any timed **[Super Modes](#heading--supermodes)** from the drop target grid can be activated while Gem Quests are running. The player can also *[level up the Avengers](#heading--assemble)* as usual during Gem Quests. Score 30M in any Gem Quest for a *[Gold Trophy](#heading--trophies)*.

### <span id="heading--gemdetails"></span>Gem Quest Details:

- **Mind Gem** (Blue) - Hulk, Marvel, Panther, and Black Widow are lit. Shooting any of them “frees” that Avenger from Supergiant’s mind control powers, and will light the disc to damage Supergiant for 100,000 points per spin. The more Avengers you free before shooting the disc adds +1x multiplier to the disc value (5x for all 4). Complete this sequence three times to light the Sanctum target for Final Blow; if the player shot the fastest blinking shot during all three rounds of shots, they will score the Final Blow with the last disc spin instead.
- **Power Gem** (Red) - Shots light in spans of 3 flashing red shots, with the center of the three shots lit for 30% damage and a value that can be built up with shots to the left spinner (one rip only) or disc; and the other two lit for 15% damage and half of the value. The critical hit shots are lit in this order: Captain Marvel, pop bumper lane, upper loop, Tower. This order will loop if not enough damage has been done. Deal enough damage to light the left orbit for Final Blow for the current critical hit value x the number of critical hits collected (+1).
- **Space Gem** (Purple) - Defeat Corvus by making combo shots. Shoot either the right orbit or upper loop to parry, and then shoot the left orbit to attack Corvus (and score 50,000 points per bumper for 5 seconds). The attack & bumper value can be multiplied by 2x or 4x by making a combo shot to the right orbit or upper loop. The upper loop always qualifies the left orbit for 2x the base value. Completing three attacks will light the left ramp and right orbit for Final Blow, with a higher bonus at the right orbit.
- **Time Gem** (Orange) - To defeat Proxima, shoot the left ramp and gauntlet ramp once each, then shoot for the cycling lit drop target on the grid. The lit target starts at 3x value, but with each shot to an unlit drop target, the multiplier decreases. Repeat the sequence 3 times to win, with the speed of the moving drop target increasing each time.
- **Reality Gem** (Yellow) - Every spin of the disc will light up the letters in STRANGE, and light all major shots yellow. The currently flashing letters in STRANGE multiple the values collected from the lit shots, with the pop bumper lane and upper loop scoring an additional 2x; these letters slowly extinguish, with later letters being active for a much shorter time, but they can be added back by spinning the disc. Shoot 8 total yellow arrows to defeat Ebony Maw and win the mode.

### <span id="heading--portallock"></span>Portal Locks & Victory Laps

Prior to starting a **[Gem Quest](#heading--gemquests)**, up to 2 **Portal Locks** can be qualified and collected at the disc through:

- **[Secret Skill Shot](#heading--skillshots)** <span class="hashtag">\#1</span>
- 4, 10, 20, etc. **[Combos](#heading--combos)**
- 1st **[Hawkeye Challenge](#heading--hawkeyechallenge)**
- **[Computer Grid award](#heading--computergrid)**

Portal Locks enable 2x / 3x scoring for the next Gem Quest as long as you keep the balls in play. Completing a Gem Quest while these locked balls are still in play enables **Victory Laps** at all major shots, which can be built up and relit by shooting the disc and are multiplied by the number of balls in play (pop bumper lane and upper loop score 2x).

### <span id="heading--gemplacing"></span>Collecting & Placing Gems

If you complete a **[Gem Quest](#heading--gemquests)**, **Collect Gem** will light at the right ramp and take priority over advancing towards any further quests until the Gem has been placed on a shot. Shoot a flashing Gem shot to place the Gem there, and light the disc to qualify the next Gem Quest. Placing a Gem on a shot will provide a perk determined by the Gem and the shot itself. Certain perks only have a limited number of uses; more uses can be added by using the **Space Gem** to change the Gem’s location or by scoring **Change Gems**, lit every time the *[Avengers have been assembled](#heading--assemble)*, and then using the flippers and action button to determine each gem’s new position.

The perks for each Gem are:

#### <a href="#mind-gem-1" id="mind-gem-1" class="anchor"></a>Mind Gem

Action button collects shots.

- When the Mind Gem has been placed, the action button will collect currently lit shots for you. After all uses are depleted, the gem must be re-placed or the Avenger leveled up in order to use it again.
- The shots collected from the action button change depending on the shot itself and the Avenger level:
  - Uncollected Avenger: 1 use on THAT shot.
  - Collected Avenger: 2 uses on THAT shot.
  - Level 1: 3 spots the *best, highest-scoring shot* anywhere on the playfield. *Each active mode is considered separately.*
  - Level 2: 1 use on **all** shots in **all** running modes, from left to right.
  - Drop targets: 3 uses that allow the player to change the lit **[grid square](#heading--computergrid)** at will. (If the computer cannot be advanced because you are in a wizard mode, it will act as hitting all the drops down.)
  - Captain Marvel: 3 uses that spots the shot. Also counts 1 ramp or 10 spins to the **[count-up award](#heading--marvelcountup)**.

#### <a href="#power-gem-2" id="power-gem-2" class="anchor"></a>Power Gem

Easier to level up Avengers. Avenger progress carries between balls and wizard modes.

- The four Avenger shots can all be impacted by this Gem in the following ways:
  - Every shot towards leveling up the Avenger with the Power Gem placed on it counts *double*.
  - The Avenger’s level, along with the shot multiplier from reaching level 2, carries over across balls.
- If placed on:
  - Drop targets: The next 3 drop target completions will award 2 **[grid squares](#heading--computergrid)**.
  - Captain Marvel: Every ramp or spinner hit towards one of the **[count-up awards](#heading--marvelcountup)** is doubled in progression.

#### <a href="#space-gem-3" id="space-gem-3" class="anchor"></a>Space Gem

Easier to change Gems. Shoot shot, move Gems.

- Shooting the Space Gem shot enables the action button for 3 seconds to move all placed Gems from left to right (as a group), wrapping around from the rightmost shot to the leftmost shot. After all uses have been depleted, the gem must be recharged. Collecting the Space Gem also makes **Change Gems** easier by extending the timer to 20 seconds. Each hit of the action button counts as a use and won’t recharge until after being depleted.
- If placed on a *Main Avenger:*
  - Uncollected: 1 use.
  - Collected: 1 use.
  - Level 1: 2 uses.
  - Level 2: 3 uses.
  - Recharge at next Avenger level.
- If placed on:
  - Drop targets: 1 use. Recharge after collecting the next **[computer grid](#heading--computergrid)** award.
  - Captain Marvel: 1 use. Recharge at the next **[count-up award](#heading--marvelcountup)**.

#### <a href="#time-gem-4" id="time-gem-4" class="anchor"></a>Time Gem

Add Time to Time Bank. Increased ball save timers.

- Shooting the Time Gem shot will add time to the Master Timer for **[Super Modes](#heading--supermodes)**, or Time Bank (if no timed mode is currently running), based on the times below.
- Multiball ball saver lengths are increased, also based on the times below.
- If placed on a *Main Avenger* that is:
  - Uncollected: 5 seconds.
  - Collected: 5 seconds.
  - Level 1: 8 seconds.
  - Level 2: 15 seconds.
- If placed on:
  - Drop targets: 10 seconds.
  - Captain Marvel: 10 seconds.

#### <a href="#reality-gem-5" id="reality-gem-5" class="anchor"></a>Reality Gem

Shot multiplier.

- If placed on a *Main Avenger* that is:
  - Uncollected: 2x multiplier.
  - Collected: 2x multiplier.
  - Level 1: 3x multiplier.
  - Level 2: 4x multiplier.
    - Replaces the normal 2x multiplier for any Level 2 Avenger.
- If placed on:
  - Drop targets: 2x multiplier. Award **[Computer Grid](#heading--computergrid)** awards for hitting 2 of 3 targets (3 times only).
  - Captain Marvel: 2x multiplier.

#### <a href="#soul-gem-6" id="soul-gem-6" class="anchor"></a>Soul Gem

Soul Gem Jackpot enabled. Failed Gem Quests can be replayed. **Black Order Multiball** extended.

- After completing a Gem Quest and collecting the Gem, Soul Gem Jackpot is lit at whatever shot the Soul Gem was placed on for a percentage of the previous Gem Quest value.
  - If placed on a *Main Avenger* that is:
    - Uncollected: 50%
    - Collected: 50%
    - Level 1: 75%
    - Level 2: 150%!
  - If placed on:
    - Drop targets: 50%
    - Captain Marvel: 50%
- Ability to replay any failed Gem Quest. If you fail the Gem Quest again after restarting it, you will lose the Soul Gem.
- Multiball extension in **[Black Order Multiball](#heading--bomb)** that can be used by holding down the action button. This replenishes your balls and activates the ball saver for a short time. However, if you fail to collect the Super Jackpot during the mode, you will lose the Soul Gem.
- Soul Gem can be reacquired by scoring a Super Jackpot in **Black Order Multiball** or winning **[Black Order Battle Royale](#heading--battleroyale)**.

## <span id="heading--assemble"></span>Avengers Assemble:

The Black Order is a big team with many members spread across the universe, but so are the Avengers… Assemble all six Avengers by shooting their shots enough times to qualify **[mini-wizard modes](#heading--assemblemodes)** and light **Change Gems**. After you’ve collected an Avenger, continue shooting that Avenger’s shot/feature to upgrade them to level 1 and level 2. Each level-up requires more shots, comes with their own perks, and enhances the benefits of the **[Gems](#heading--gemplacing)** placed there. Advance any Avenger to level 2 for a *[Trophy](#heading--trophies)*.

The six required Avengers, listed from the left to right side of the playfield, are as follows:

- **Hulk**
  - Shoot the left orbit spinner enough times.
    - Level 1: 2x **[Hulk Rampage](#heading--supermodes)** scoring.
    - Level 2: 2x left orbit multiplier.
  - Every time Hulk is collected or has been leveled up, the right inlane will light to start **\[Gamma Ray\]** for 15 seconds of huge left spinner points.
- **Iron Man**
  - Spell I-R-O-N at the return lanes enough times.
    - Level 1: All **[Arc Reactor](#heading--arcreactor)** shots score 2x.
    - Level 2: **[Iron Man Multiball](#heading--immb)** scores 2x.
- **Captain America**
  - Make enough pop bumper hits. (Shooting the pop bumper lane counts as 10 pop bumper hits.)
    - Level 1: All pop bumper hits score 2x.
    - Level 2: 2x pop bumper lane multiplier.
- **Black Widow**
  - Shoot the left ramp enough times.
    - Level 1: Left inlane briefly lights captive ball for 2x THOR letters.
    - Level 2: 2x left ramp multiplier.
- **Thor**
  - Spell T-H-O-R at the captive ball enough times.
    - Level 1: Super Slings (100K per hit).
    - Level 2: 2x captive ball multiplier.
- **Black Panther**:
  - Shoot the right orbit enough times.
    - Level 1: 3 seconds added to **[Combo](#heading--combos)** timer.
    - Level 2: 2x right orbit multiplier.

</div>

### <span id="heading--assemblemodes"></span>Mini-Wizard Modes:

Once the six Avengers have been assembled, the right ramp will light to start one of the three **mini-wizard modes** in the following order:

#### <span id="heading--soulgemquest"></span>Soul Gem Quest:

As the mode begins, you have the option of playing *Normal Mode* or *Hard Mode* (enabled by holding the action button during the mode start animation). Normal Mode gives you 30 flips and adds more flips per shot, but scores lower; while Hard Mode gives you 20 flips and adds less flips per shot, but scores 10x the value of Normal Mode.

The objective of the mode is to shoot 8 lit green shots without running out of flips; shooting a green shot will add flips and draining the ball will subtract flips. **[Mystery](#heading--mystery)** and **Flank Attack** will both spot the currently lit shot (up to once each), but not the final shot at the Tower. **[Mind Gem](#heading--gemplacing)** is also available, but will not spot the final shot at the Tower either.

The shots always progress in the same order:

- Right orbit
- Left ramp
- Right ramp
- Left orbit
- Captive ball
- Drop targets
- Captain Marvel (ramp shot on Prem/LE, 30 spins on Pro)
- Tower

Upon completion, you acquire the **Soul Gem** and score a bonus for each remaining flip. If you run out of flips, you will lose the Quest, and return to normal single ball play, with no ball saver. If you drain with 1 to 5 flips left, you will lose the Quest, but your ball will be saved and plunged into normal single ball play. If the player failed the mode, the Soul Gem can be reacquired by scoring the Super Jackpot in **[Black Order Multiball](#heading--bomb)** or defeating the Black Order in **[Black Order Battle Royale](#heading--battleroyale)**; or by completing the **[Hawkeye Challenge](#heading--hawkeyechallenge)** at Marksman difficulty.

#### <span id="heading--bomb"></span>Black Order Multiball:

All six main Avengers are lit. After certain thresholds of shots are made to them (listed below), a Jackpot will be lit at the upper loop. The more Avengers you collect, the higher the jackpot value, and the higher the jackpot multiplier. Each time you light a jackpot, Captain Marvel will also light for an additional jackpot multiplier.

After collecting the jackpot, spin the disc to spell STRANGE and light super jackpot at the pop bumper lane. Super Jackpot will award a base value of 5 million + all jackpots collected since the last super jackpot, unlight the jackpot if it’s lit, add a ball, give you back your **Soul Gem** if you lost it, and reset the Avengers qualification process to start over again. Drop targets during this mode will boost the Jackpot and boost the “Avenger Value”, which is a small amount of points you get for working towards lighting a jackpot (and also how much goes in to the jackpot).

If you’ve collected the Soul Gem prior to starting the multiball, you can hold the action button at any time to risk your Soul Gem and enable a “Multiball Extender” which will restart your multiball when you drain down to one ball. If you risk the Soul Gem and fail to get a Super Jackpot, you will lose it. If you haven’t collected a super jackpot, there is a fairly generous timer after draining down to one ball to allow you to collect one last jackpot or super jackpot.

#### <span id="heading--battleroyale"></span>Black Order Battle Royale:

It’s time to bring the fight to the Black Order for real. You have 6 lives, represented by the 6 Avenger inserts in the middle of the playfield, and each insert corresponds to their respective shot. Each Avenger has a health bar; if the health bar reaches 0%, the Avenger will tap out and be replaced by a new one. The health bar decreases through various factors:

- Depleting the number of given flips on the display
- Timer reaching 0
- Draining a ball (deals a ton of damage)

The members of the Black Order are represented by all of the shots being lit, and clearing waves of shots will defeat members. The longer you keep an Avenger alive, the more points you get for successful attacks and the more bonus points you’ll score.

The supporting characters also have roles in the mode; making their shots will give you some helpful perks.

- Drop targets - Summons Vision to add 8 flips, reducing the chance of damage being taken.
- Disc - Spelling STRANGE lights a rotating Power-Up insert for 3x damage, 4x if there’s also an arrow shot on there. Times out after 10 seconds but can be reactivated with another spin. More spins move the power up around.
- Captain Marvel - Freezes the timer for a short time, reducing the chance of damage being taken from time running out.
- Hawkeye - Shooting the upper loop will light the three shots on the left for an attack. If you shoot an already lit arrow this way it’ll count as 2 attacks for the price of one.
- Antman - Deals damage the first time (ie. a normal shot during the mode). The second time, summons Wasp to add another ball into play, multiplying all scores and damage by 2x.

If you defeat the Black Order, you are awarded a bonus based on remaining Avengers (20M per Avenger), remaining flips (1M per flip), and remaining time (1M per second remaining).

## <span id="heading--thanos"></span>Thanos Modes:

After making enough progress on both **[Gem Quests](#heading--gemquests)** and **[Avengers Assemble](#heading--assemble)**, the next shot to the right ramp when the portal has been opened will start a battle against Thanos. There are two modes using this structure: **Thanos Attacks!** occurs after obtaining at least two Gems and the **Soul Gem**, while **Battle Thanos** occurs after attempting all six Gem Quests and playing all three **mini-wizard modes**.

### <span id="heading--thanosattacks"></span>Thanos Attacks!:

After obtaining at least two Gems and the **Soul Gem**, the next shot to the lit right ramp will begin this mode where the player must defend any Gems they have collected. First, shoot a Gem shot to select it, then shoot the left orbit, left ramp, and the right orbit; then shoot the right ramp to defend that Gem, all within 45 seconds per Gem (lit shots add 5 seconds, and drop targets add 15 seconds to the timer). **Flank Attack** and the **Mind Gem** can be used to collect any lit shot, but won’t spot the right ramp. There is a short ball saver at the start of the mode.

If the mode ends through timing out or draining, Thanos will take the gem you were trying to defend away. When you’re down to the last undefended gem, the defense for that gem starts immediately. The number of Gems you have before starting this mode determines the value of the shots; the more you have, the higher the scoring is.

If you successfully defend all of the Gems you have collected, you will win back a previously lost Gem (if you’ve failed a previous Gem Quest) or start the 3-ball **[Super Victory Laps](#heading--supervictory)** multiball.

### <span id="heading--battlethanos"></span>Battle Thanos:

After attempting all six Gem Quests and playing all three **[mini-wizard modes](#heading--assemblemodes)**, the next shot to the lit right ramp will start the final battle against Thanos. This mode starts as a four-ball Multiball, with sets of shots flashing both red and blue to deal damage to Thanos. Hitting the disc will rotate these shots around; if you hit a shot that is flashing both colors at once, 2x damage will be delivered. The gems impact how quickly your health is drained during this mode when you enter the single-ball phase. Completing THOR will add a ball.

After enough damage has been dealt, the final blow will be at the Tower, which will defeat Thanos once and for all, and show a final victory cutscene before displaying the mode total and proceeding to 6-ball **[Super Victory Laps](#heading--supervictory)**. If you start this mode after collecting all 6 Gems, you automatically complete the mode and score a 1 billion point bonus for your hard work.

### <span id="heading--supervictory"></span>Super Victory Laps:

A 3 ball multiball version can be started by successfully defending all Gems in Thanos Attacks, without having failed a Gem Quest; while a 6 ball multiball version can be started by completing Battle Thanos. Super Victory Laps is a higher scoring version of normal **Victory Laps** where the base value starts at 500,000 points rather than 250,000, and all scores are multiplied by the number of balls in play.

## <span id="heading--multiball"></span>Multiball Modes:

### <span id="heading--immb"></span>Iron Man Multiball

Spell I-R-O-N at the return lanes (which only change by spinning the disc, not via lane-change!), or collect “Light Lock” from the **[computer grid](#heading--computergrid)**, to light the 3 locks at the Tower shot (only one lock for subsequent multiballs). Lock 3 balls to start Iron Man Multiball. If **Iron Man** has been advanced to *[level 2](#heading--assemble)* before starting Iron Man Multiball, all jackpot scoring during the multiball will be doubled.

Iron Man Multiball works in different phases, and each phase awards higher base jackpot values than the last. In each phase, two jackpot shots light at a time, and collecting them both will qualify the super jackpot at the Tower for 10 seconds, with a double super jackpot opportunity if two balls are shot into the tower at once. The jackpots start at 1 million and increase by 500,000 per jackpot phase played in the same multiball attempt. Shots to the disc will increase the jackpot by 12,500 per spin until Iron Man Multiball ends.

In order, the lit jackpot lanes are:

- Left ramp and gauntlet ramp
- Left orbit and right orbit
- Pop bumper lane and Captain Marvel
- Tower and upper orbit

Collecting the two jackpots during the fourth phase will light the disc for a Super Jackpot worth 250k per disc spin for 22 seconds (adjustable from 16 to 30 seconds) and awarding or upgrade the corresponding *[Trophy](#heading--trophies)*. The process of completing jackpot phases to light the super jackpots will then reset.

Balls can be added during Iron Man Multiball once per activation by completing the IRON lanes, then shooting the Sanctum target behind the disc.

### <span id="heading--tmb"></span>Thor Multiball

Thor Multiball is an easy objective for novice players to start, simply requiring three shots to the captive ball to start it at first (T & H are already spotted for you at the start of the game).

The second Thor Multiball requires spelling T-H-O-R twice to light; the third and thereafter require spelling T-H-O-R three times. If **Black Widow** has reached *[level 1](#heading--assemble)*, the left inlane will light the captive ball to collect 2 THOR letters for 5 seconds. Advancing **Thor** to level 2 before starting Thor Multiball will cause all jackpot scoring during the multiball to be doubled.

During Thor Multiball, all shots will light to collect jackpots worth 200,000 points + 2,500 for each spin of the disc. Once a jackpot has been collected, the captive ball will light to score a Mjolnir Attack worth the current jackpot value multiplied by the number of THOR letters that have been collected so far. Shots to the pops lane and upper orbit will score double jackpots and also increase the Mjolnir Attack value twice as much.

This sequence then repeats - 2 jackpots then captive ball, 3 jackpots then captive ball, etc. until you spell THOR with four runs through the sequence. Super Jackpot will then light at Avengers Tower to score 20x the jackpot value and collect the Thor Multiball *[Trophy](#heading--trophies)*. The process then resets, with additional jackpot shots being required to qualify the captive ball.

Spell STRANGE at the disc to summon the Eye of Agamotto, then shoot the Sanctum target to add another ball into play! Every time Thor Multiball is played in a game and a ball has been added, more and more spins will be required to light the Sanctum target.

## <span id="heading--otherfeatures"></span>Other Scoring:

### <span id="heading--computergrid"></span>Computer Grid Awards:

The currently lit award on the Computer Grid cycles until any drop target is hit - complete the remaining drop targets, or make enough **[Hawkeye Combos](#heading--combos)**, to collect the award. Collecting 3 awards, thus completing a line on the grid, will award features or start a **[Super Mode](#heading--supermodes)**. These are randomly arranged each game (they will remain the same for all the players in a multiplayer game), so the same row won’t always award the same feature or start the same Super Mode every game.

Features that can be swapped in after Super Modes have been played are:

- 10 Million
- +5x Bonus
- Light **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)**
- Collect Bonus (doubled by Reality Gem)
- Light **[Change Gems](#heading--gemplacing)**
- *[Trophy](#heading--trophies)* (three instances of this award for Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Light **[Computer Frenzy](#heading--computerfrenzy)**

#### <span id="heading--supermodes"></span>Super Modes:

All six Super Modes will be available on the grid at the start of a game, with the other two awards being **[Portal Lock](#heading--portallock)** and Super Ball Saver (30 seconds). After collecting an award, the next one on a list shown in instant info will replace its position on the grid.

All of the Super Modes share the same timer, which can be increased with the **[Time Gem](#heading--gemplacing)**. Starting an additional mode while others are running will reset the timer for all active modes. Score 30M in any Super Mode to win a Gold *[Trophy](#heading--trophies)*.

- **Hulk Rampage**: All shots lit green for big points starting at 800k a piece, complete them all to relight them. The value of each shot increases by 50k each time one is made. Shooting the spinner at any time while the timer is active will also boost the value of the lit shots by 5k per spin. *[Level 1](#heading--assemble)* Hulk boosts scoring in this mode by 2x.
- **Super Arc Reactor**: Arc Reactor is lit for the entirety of the mode. Each hit awards the arc reactor bonus with a multiplier up to 4X depending on the strength of the shot, and boosts the base value of the shot by higher amounts depending on the strength. The base value at 1x is 600k (2.4 million at 4x), increasing by 50k for each hit.
- **Super Gauntlet**: Right ramp lit, loop the ramp as many times as possible for increasing scores. Successive shots double the 50k points added to the base value of 800k (ie. 850k, 950k, 1,150m…). A shot to Flank Attack will collect the most recently scored value one time only.
- **Super Targets**: Shoot targets for 4 million a hit. Completing all three Hawkeye targets boosts the value of all of the targets by 250k. Complete 2 sets of targets during the mode to light an **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)** as well!
- **Super Combos**: Shoot **[Combos](#heading--combos)** for big points. Along with the normal progression towards combos, each combo will collect a bonus value of 300k + 50k per combo, which is multiplied for each successive shot in the combo; and each combo counts 2x to scoring one of their awards.
- **Super Disc**: Shoot disc in either direction for points, then shoot the disc in the other direction to increase the multiplier for each spin up to 5x per spin.

#### <span id="heading--computerfrenzy"></span>Computer Frenzy Multiball:

Qualified by playing all 6 **[Super Modes](#heading--supermodes)**, this multiball will be the next grid award at whatever the most recently completed Super Mode’s position was. After qualifying it, a shot to the right ramp will start the mode.

In this Multiball, all shots are lit in colors that represent the different inserts on the bingo grid (ie. left orbit = yellow, Tower = teal, etc.). Completing a shot will spot its corresponding grid lamp and score a jackpot; making a bingo on the grid will score a super jackpot. Completing a “double” bingo awards two double super jackpots (4x), and completing a “triple” bingo awards three triple super jackpots (9x). The Jackpot value can be boosted by the drop targets and each super jackpot also boosts the jackpot value. Completing the drop targets during this Multiball will award an additional ball, up to two times.

### <span id="heading--combos"></span>Combos, Combo Jackpot & Hawkeye Combos:

**Combo** shots flash white after making any major shot on the playfield (or flashing rainbow if in **[Super Combos](#heading--supermodes)**). Combo scoring increases based on the *[trophies](#heading--trophies)* that have been obtained, up to 20k per gold trophy. Certain thresholds of combos will light the insert at the right orbit in rainbow colors to collect the **Combo Jackpot**, which scores all the points that were scored from previous combo shots again. The shot has to go all the way around the right orbit to count, and if the ball drains while Combo Jackpot is lit, it will have to be relit on the next ball.

The number of combos made accumulates across your entire game, and reaching certain thresholds provides different awards:

- 4 combos - Light **[Portal Lock](#heading--portallock)**
- 8 combos - Light **Combo Jackpot**
- 10 combos - Light Portal Lock
- 12 combos - Light Combo Jackpot
- 20 combos - Light Portal Lock & Combo Jackpot
- 30 combos - Light Combo Jackpot + *Bronze Trophy*
- 35 combos - Light Portal Lock
- 40 combos - Light Combo Jackpot + *Silver Trophy*
- 45 combos - Light Portal Lock
- 50 combos - Light **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)** + *Gold Trophy*
- 55 combos - Light Portal Lock & Combo Jackpot
- 60, 65, 70, 65, etc. - alternates between Portal Lock and Light Combo Jackpot

**Hawkeye Combos** can be scored by repeatedly shooting the right ramp to increase the combo multiplier (up to 3x & 3 shots towards the next award), followed by a shot to the upper loop to collect the combo. These combos don’t progress towards the awards listed above, though scoring 3, 8, 13, etc. Hawkeye Combos spots the currently lit **[grid square](#heading--computergrid)** and a *Trophy* can be scored after 10, 20, and 30 Hawkeye Combos.

### <span id="heading--arcreactor"></span>Arc Reactor Bonus:

Completing the drop targets will light the Tower for the Arc Reactor Bonus, which can be multiplied up to 4x depending on the strength of the shot. The base value of the bonus can be boosted by collecting unlit IRON letters, and multiplied by collecting the 2x Arc Reactor **[grid award](#heading--computergrid)** or having **Iron Man** at *[Level 1](#heading--assemble)*. The base value of the Arc Reactor Bonus is 75k, and carries over between balls until it has been collected.

### <span id="heading--hawkeyechallenge"></span>Hawkeye Challenge:

Shoot the 3 Bullseye targets enough times, then shoot Avengers Tower to start **Hawkeye Challenge** when lit. If Hawkeye Challenge is already lit and you reach a target completion threshold, the point value for completing Hawkeye Challenge will be increased by 2 million points. The bullseye targets award the following:

- 1 completion - Light Hawkeye Challenge
- 3 completions - Light **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)**
- 7 completions - Light Hawkeye Challenge (or boost point value if Hawkeye Challenge lit)
- +4 from last award - Light Hawkeye Challenge (or boost point value if Hawkeye Challenge lit)

Hawkeye Challenge starts at level 1, and increases in level each time it is successfully completed, up to level 3 (Marksman). If applicable, pressing the action button during Hawkeye Challenge will automatically activate level 3.

- Amateur (Level 1): Timed release, hit either the inner loop or bullseye target for a lit **[Portal Lock](#heading--portallock)** + 3M.
- Pro (Level 2): Timed release, hit the inner loop for an **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)**.
- Marksman (Level 3): Random release after all three lock inserts light, hit the inner loop for an uncollected **[Gem](#heading--gemquests)** + 10M.

### <span id="heading--shieldbonus"></span>Shield Bonus:

Pop bumpers increase your current Shield Bonus based on how high of a *[level](#heading--assemble)* **Captain America** is, and also increase the base value of it by a much smaller amount. Shooting the upper loop lights Captain America for 15 seconds to collect the Shield Bonus and a *[Trophy](#heading--trophies)*. Once collected, the value resets. The Shield Bonus can be doubled until it is collected by collecting 2x Shield off the **[Computer Grid](#heading--computergrid)**; level 2 Captain America also doubles it, as does the **[Reality Gem](#heading--gemplacing)**. The base value of the Shield Bonus is 6 million, and carries over between balls until it has been collected.

### <span id="heading--marvelcountup"></span>Captain Marvel Count-Up:

Shots to the Captain Marvel shot are accumulated throughout the game, and awards can be collected by making enough shots. On the Pro, making enough spins will collect the award, while on the Premium / LE, the ramp has to be made. If the Power Gem is placed on this shot, each spinner or ramp hit will count as double towards the progress. Awards are:

- 3 ramps/90 spins - **[Binary Hurry-Up](#heading--binary)** + Light **[Mystery](#heading--mystery)**
- 6 ramps/180 spins - Binary Hurry-Up + Light Mystery
- 10 ramps/300 spins - Light Mystery
- 12 ramps/360 spins - Light Mystery
- 15 ramps/450 spins - Binary Hurry-Up + Light Mystery
- 18 ramps/540 spins - *Bronze [Trophy](#heading--trophies)*

- 48 ramps/1440 spins - *Gold Trophy*
- 50 ramps/1500 spins - Light **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)**

#### <span id="heading--binary"></span>Binary Hurry-Up:

Quick, two-shot hurry-up starting at 5 million points. Shoot the left ramp or Captain Marvel to collect the value, then shoot the shot you didn’t make to collect another hurry-up starting at double the value. The points increase by 1 million each time the hurry-up is collected. On the Prem / LE model, each completed hurry-up results in +1X added to the Captain Marvel ramp multiplier, which maxes out at 5X. This multiplier isn’t available on the Pro.

### <span id="heading--mystery"></span>Mystery:

Mystery can be lit at the Ant-Man shot in several ways, either from enough shots to **[Captain Marvel](#heading--marvelcountup)** or after successfully making the first **[Super Skill Shot](#heading--skillshots)** in a game. Possible awards are:

- Add-A-Ball (once per *[Multiball](#heading--multiballs)*)
- Spot Soul Gem Shot (during **[Soul Gem Quest](#heading--soulgemquest)**)
- Spot 3 STRANGE Letters

- Spot **Captain Marvel** Shots (+3 ramps Prem / LE, +45 spins Pro)
- 10 Million
- Begin *[Timed Mode](#heading--supermodes)*\* (if a super mode is already running, this will always be awarded)

Extra balls can be qualified at the Sanctum target through these methods:

- 3 completions of the Bullseye targets
- 2 waves of **[Super Targets](#heading--supermodes)**
- 8 *[Trophies](#heading--trophies)*
- 2nd **[Hawkeye Challenge](#heading--hawkeyechallenge)**
- Late-game **[Computer Grid Award](#heading--computergrid)**
- 50 **[combos](#heading--combos)**

### <span id="heading--funwithbonus"></span>End-of-Ball Bonus:

Each of the following are how many of these you’ve made THIS ball:

- Switches x 250
- **[Computer Grid](#heading--computergrid)** Squares x 25K
- **[Arc Reactors](#heading--arcreactor)** x 25K
- Upper loop shots x 25K
- **[Combos](#heading--combos)** x 25K

These are saved throughout your whole game:

- *Bronze [Trophies](#heading--trophies)* x 100K
- *Silver Trophies* x 250K
- *Gold Trophies* x 500K
- **[Gems](#heading--gemquests)** Collected x 250K

All multiplied by the bonus X, which can be increased by making shots to the pop bumper lane or from **Computer Grid** awards, to a max of 25x.

### <span id="heading--gemmania"></span>Gem Mania (Topper / IC Mode):

(Also known as: Stone Frenzy, Ornament Chaos, Egg Madness, etc.)

This 3-ball multiball mode can be started in two different ways:

- If the topper is installed, the topper displays all six of the Infinity Gems, which light up once you’ve collected them; all six gems need to be collected to start the mode.
- If Insider Connected has been enabled, Gem Mania will be the second **[Computer Grid](#heading--computergrid)** award to be added to a row that has already been completed. If collected off of the grid during any multiball mode, Gem Mania will stack into the multiball.

After achieving either method, Gem Mania instantly begins for 1M. All shots will be lit with white arrows, and score jackpots of 150k; while the gems on the topper will all be unlit. The goal of the mode is to light up all six gems again by making switch hits - the first gem will light at 50 switch hits, and each subsequent gem will require 10 more. Once a gem is lit, all six of the gem inserts on the playfield will light up and score a final jackpot worth 5k times the number of switches that have been hit so far, times a multiplier that increases by 1x each time a final jackpot has been collected. The mode automatically ends with all three balls returning to the trough once the 6th final jackpot has been collected.

If two balls drain before scoring the 6th final jackpot, the gauntlet ramp will remain lit for 10 seconds to score one last final jackpot times the current multiplier. Up to three balls can be added, even during single-ball play, by spelling THOR at the captive ball.

## <span id="heading--trophies"></span>Trophies:

Trophies are the game’s achievement system for various gameplay goals - completing any **[Gem Quest](#heading--gemquests)**, **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)**, **[count-up feature](#heading--otherfeatures)**, **[super mode](#heading--supermodes)**, or **[mini-wizard mode](#heading--assemblemodes)**. These are awarded at Bronze, Silver, or Gold levels. Trophies increase the **[Combo](#heading--combos)** values and add up in **[bonus](#heading--funwithbonus)**, but above all, collecting 24 out of the game’s 32 trophies is the only way to access the game’s true wizard mode, **[Trophy Mania](#heading--trophymania)**.

Hard Mode can be enabled in the settings. This disables 8 of the 32 trophies, but all scoring during Trophy Mania will be tripled if you reach it!

### <span id="heading--trophymania"></span>Trophy Mania:

A shot to the right ramp after collecting 24 trophies will start Trophy Mania. When the mode starts, depending on how many of each type of trophy you collected, a portion of the 8 RGB shots are lit corresponding to that type. For example, if you collected 12 bronze, 6 silver, and 6 gold trophies, then 4 shots are lit for bronze, 2 shots lit for silver, and 2 shots lit for gold (RGB colors are tan for bronze, white for silver, and yellow for gold).

All lit shots score Trophy Jackpots based on what type of trophy the arrow is, and will add a trophy to the case shown on the display. Base jackpot value is 1 million and shots to the disc increase it - this is multiplied by 2x or 4x for silver and gold trophies, respectively. Shots can be moved either by hitting the captive ball to move all the trophies one shot to the right, or by simply collecting a jackpot, which will swap the trophy with the closest, different-colored shot to the right. This means all shots will continuously be lit to score, but the higher value trophies will require more effort to go for.

At 12 Trophies and 24 Trophies, a ball will be added. Collecting 24 trophies fills the trophy case and lights Super Jackpot at Ant-Man. When super is lit, the drop targets will light to form one-time bingo(s) to multiply the super by 2x, 3x, or 5x based on how many bingos were collected at once. When the super is lit, the RGB arrows will still continue to award Trophy Jackpots (and increase the super jackpot), but will not collect trophies (thus not advancing towards next add-a-ball) until you collect the super. Once super is collected you can start working on another case. Super Jackpot value is the total score of all previous Trophy Jackpots.

Once the mode is over, you’re back to square one. If you have all six gems, **[Gem Quests](#heading--gemquests)** will be disabled for the rest of the game, though **[mini-wizard modes](#heading--assemblemodes)** to be played. The trophy case will reset, making it possible to get another **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)** from 8 trophies, but it will be very tough to get to Trophy Mania again in the same game.

## <span id="heading--faq"></span>FAQ:

**I’ve never played this pinball machine before, and it looks like so much to take in! What should I do?**

The game can easily be divided into three aspects: Gem Quests (STRANGE then the right ramp), assembling the Avengers (shoot their shots enough times), and super modes (complete lines of computer grid awards). Most of the complexity in *Avengers Infinity Quest* comes from the specific Gem perks. A good strategy for beginner players is to focus on scoring the first Portal Lock at 4 combos before their first Gem Quest, then starting Thor Multiball with captive ball hits during the Gem Quest.

**I won a battle, but what should I do next?**

Shoot the right ramp after winning any battle to collect the Gem, then place it on any shot with a flashing Gem insert. Just because you’ve won the battle doesn’t mean you can instantly make progress towards the next one.

**Why aren’t the IRON letters changing when I press the flippers?**

Keith Elwin doesn’t play nice… if you want to complete IRON, you’ll have to rely on alley passing, or shooting the disc to change the lit IRON letters’ location.

**What’s up with the drop target grid?**

You ever played a game of BINGO before? If so, the grid should end up being familiar to you. The goal with the grid is to complete lines of grid awards. The lit grid award roves from space to space and can be locked in by shooting any drop target. Check the instant info to determine which award you want and try going for it!

**Why did the game suddenly go dark and flash green over and over?!**

If you collected or leveled up Hulk with left spinner hits, then rolled through the right inlane, Gamma Ray will start and you will be *damn* sure of it because the audiovisual display takes precedence over all currently active features. Shoot the left spinner as many times as possible while this happening for a chance to score big points.

**What the heck is going on during Change Gems?**

You’re not seeing things - use the flippers and action button to determine where you want to place each Gem. This is a very strategic feature, only recommended for players who know how the Gems work and are willing to experiment; otherwise it can safely be ignored.

**Is the Binary Hurry-Up random?**

Shooting the Captain Marvel shot enough times to collect enough of either spinners or ramps starts the Binary Hurry-Up, which can be scored at the left ramp and Captain Marvel shot. Try going for this on the Prem / LE in particular as this can help advance the Captain Marvel shot multiplier. This mode can score way more than just 1s and 0s.
