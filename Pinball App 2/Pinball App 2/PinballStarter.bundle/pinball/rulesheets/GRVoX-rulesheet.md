## Quickie Version

First choice is UTAD. If you happen to need only one or two drop targets to complete all ten, do so, then shoot the black targets for 5K each. On ball 5, go for drop targets.

## Skill Shot

B lane at the top. From the B lane, the ball hits the center bumper and goes … wherever. From the A and C lanes, the ball might go SDTM; it \*should\* drop cleanly through the bumpers and land on the flipper below at a speed allowing you to let it dead bounce across and trap up on the other flipper. If so, fine, but observe other players’ results or test it before your game, if permitted, to see where A and C plunges go.

## Full Rules

Strategy: UTAD until ball 5. Try to bank the ball off one of the bumpers and into one of the saucers. Saucers score 1000 \\ 1000 per A/B/C letter collected.

You may see players shoot drops before ball 5. You can, but rebounds from the drops are risky. The one situation where shooting drops is okay early in the game is if you find that the rebound from a particular drop target goes up top and lands in a saucer. This is most likely for the top two targets on each side. Drop targets advance bonus; completing all drops in both banks will reset just the two center \[black\] targets, which are then worth 5000 each.

On ball 5, the bonus is automatically doubled, so shooting drops is more valuable. Bonus maxes at 15K. (When set to 3 balls, completing A-B-C activates double bonus on balls 1 and 2 and scores triple bonus on ball 3. On 5 balls, completing A-B-C does not change the bonus multiplier; it’s single bonus on balls 1-4, double bonus on ball 5.)

When shooting drops, try to hit them one at a time\\ While getting two at once makes better progress towards completing them, there’s no reward for that until all ten are down \[see above\]. Until then, hitting two drops at once, or worse two on one side and one or more on the other via a quick rebound, scores only 1 bonus advance\\ Yes, the drops advance bonus, but it’s not one advance per target down, it’s one advance per “registered” drop. Getting more than one too quickly doesn’t score as multiple hits; Fast Draw registers target hits slowly enough that this is a common occurrence.

“Fast” Draw often plays slow, so be careful when dead bouncing to make sure the ball is moving fast enough to make it across. But a fast-falling dead bounce will sometimes roll all the way up the side A or C lane, collecting it. You want that\\

## Playfield Risk

Bumper slams down the middle or outlanes, so make sure you don’t hit them face on when going UTAD. When the ball falls towards the inlane divider posts it can rattle atop them and bounce out either the center or the outlanes. The drop targets have rebound risk as well.
