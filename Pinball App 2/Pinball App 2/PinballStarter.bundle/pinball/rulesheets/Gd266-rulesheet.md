## <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots

The plunger on this game is player-controlled. Plunging at full strength will usually result in the ball completing the orbit.

**Regular Skill Shots**

Skill shots are selectable with the flipper prior to the plunge. Currently selected skill shot will appear with an orange arrow. To collect the award, no other switch may be triggered. The skill shot value and award are both doubled if you do not flip.

1.  Sneak: Collect 5 water/spice
2.  Scoop: Collect 10 water/spice
3.  Left spinner: Light all water/spice

**Secret Skill Shots**

1.  Tunnel: Spinners generate more resources
2.  Left Outlane: Immediately load Sand Snork and autoplunge another ball
3.  Upper right ramp: 5M + “Satisfaction”

## <span id="heading--daynightcycle"></span>Day & Night cycle

Game will cycle between day & night, the HAL will be orange or blue respectively. You can track the advancement of the current cycle on the half moon at the top of the LCD screen. Each switch hit will make progress towards the next cycle. By default, a day/night will last 200 switch hits.

You can play one mode per cycle:

- **Day:** Harvester battle
- **Night:** Prophecy mode

## <span id="heading--resources"></span>Resources

There are 2 resources in the game: Water & Spice. The current quantities collected are tracked at the upper left & right respectively of the LCD screen.

Small dots in front of each shot (blue for Water, orange for Spice) represent collectable resources. Making a shot will collect all resources in front of it.

To spread resources on the playfield, you need to activate spinners by hitting the left inlane when lit. Once active, each spinner will be lit (blue for Water, orange for Spice) and each switch hit will add a single resource dot to the playfield.

Each resource collected during the game will be tallied during the end of ball bonus.

### <span id="heading--water"></span>Water

Generated at night.\
Water will be consumed during a Harvester battle, acting as a mode timer. Once water as run out, the battle will end.\
Water left will increase the sacrifice jackpot

### <span id="heading--spice"></span>Spice

Generated during the day.\
All spice will be consumed when starting a Prophecy mode, increasing its base value by 1M for each spice consumed.

## <span id="heading--items"></span>Items

Items can be collected by hitting the 3 drop targets next to the upper flipper.

The active item can be changed by using the right flipper, cycling it from top to bottom.

First drop target hit will lock the item to be collected. You need to drop them all to successfully collect it. You have a limited amount of time to do so since they will reset after X secs.

After collecting the first item of a type, you will need to collect the other 2 item types before being able to collect another of the same type.

#### <span id="heading--sandsnork"></span>Sand Snork

Left outlane ball save. Load/enabled at the yellow-lit left ramp once collected from the drops. An unused loaded Snork will be ejected at the end of your ball, but you'll begin next ball with lit left ramp for easy reload. On default settings, you can stack up to 3 Snorks in your inventory.

#### <span id="heading--lasegun"></span>Lasegun

Blue shot during Harvester battles to deal massive damage. You begin each game with one Lasegun in your inventory.

#### <span id="heading--thumper"></span>Thumper

Playfield multiplier. Value increases the more Thumper you have when you active it. (1 = 2x, 2 = 3x, 3 = 4x). You \*cannot\* use a Thumper PFx during Prophecy modes.

## <span id="heading--harvesterbattle"></span>Harvester battle

There are 6 Harvester inserts on the playfield and you can battle one per day cycle. 2nd Harvester successfully destroyed will award an extra ball.

Each battles adds more defenders and health to the Harvester. Each lit shot will damage the Harvester until it is ready to be destroyed when the Worm/Harvester shot is lit yellow.

Water is consumed during a battle. If water runs out before the Harvester is destroyed, the battle ends early and will need to be resumed the next day. Note that a bonus time is given, and will run down before water starts being consumed, if the water level is low at the start of the battle.

- Worm area: Switch on the side and inside the Worm will damage the Harvester.
- Red shots: Harkonnen soldiers defending the Harvester.
- Yellow roving shots: A Ornithopter. They are also shown on the playfield screen.
- Blue shots: Use a Lasegun charge to deal massive damage to the Harvester.

The final yellow shot to destroy the Harvester requires the ball to make the jump into the area below the Harvester toy at the back. Alternatively, you can shoot a lit blue shot to use a Lasegun charge instead.

Once destroyed, the Worm will be called. Its progress is visible with the yellow line inserts going from the Thumper bumper to the Worm. During that time, you can collect any slain soldiers (blue shots) to collect water and feed them to the Worm. This will also increase the sacrifice jackpot reward. If the Worm doesn’t eat the ball before reaching the area, the sacrifice jackpot will be missed and the battle ends.

## <span id="heading--prophecymodes"></span>Prophecy modes

Prophecy modes are only available in night time.

The next mode will have its insert flashing yellow. You can change which mode is next by doing the right or left orbits, moving the current mode down & up respectively.

Each prophecy mode has a mid-point cash out option. At that point, you can choose to take the jackpot points offered and end the mode, or continue and risk it all for a 5x reward as a hurry-up (minimum of half the cash out value) on the last shot. You also gain a perk for the rest of the game if you successfully shoot the hurry-up before it times out.

Once completed, the prophecy mode insert will stay lit:Green if you cashed out at the mid-point or Blue for full completion.

### <span id="heading--train"></span>Train

Spar with Gurney Halleck to home your fighting skills.

Start by shooting a ball into the desert power field. Doing so will auto-plunge a second ball.

Bash the captive ball to spar until the meter is depleted.

Then shoot the center or right ramp to reach the mid-point cash out.

Continuing, bash the captive ball to spar until the meter is depleted. Once depleted, the captive ball will be released.

Shoot the lit shot to make a move or shoot the desert power field to move the lit shot.

Once made, send one ball back into the desert power field.

**Perk:** Gurney will take out soldiers in Harvester battle.

### <span id="heading--survive"></span>Survive

Need to find the right pitch to compel the Harkonnen soldier to ungag Jessica.

A single shot is the correct one. All shots will be lit at the start. When a shot is made, if not the correct one, will unlit all shots on the side of the playfield that doesn’t contain the correct shot.

ie: If the correct shot is the left ramp and I make the center spinner shot, both desert power field shots, the side ramp & right ramp will be unlit.

Once made, the right ramp will lower to trap the ball into the Sietch mountain for the mid-point cash out.

Continuing, Paul & Jessica need to reach 5000m of altitude to survive the storm.\
Ramp shots will be lit to gain altitude:

- Orange shot gains 1000m.
- Blue shot gains 500m.

**Perk:** One ‘The Voice’ right outlane save per ball.

### <span id="heading--ride"></span>Ride

Shoot lit shots to find the best Thumper location.

Blue shot will represent the next Thumper location to try.\

Next, Center ramp and Right ramp will be lit to reach the cash out.

If continuing, the Worm will be lit to start riding it.\
Worm will grab the ball and partially raise up, causing a second ball will be auto plunged.\
The Worm needs to be bashed 3 (4?) times, each hit will make the Worm raise up more.\
When enough shots are made, the right orbit will be lit to set the first hook.\
Second hook is set by making the left ramp. Ball will then be stopped by the hook and sent to drain.

Finally, Worm will complete its rise and release the previously captured ball onto the wireform.\
This activates a hurry-up at the center ramp & left ramp.\
Once made, the prophecy is completed with Paul riding Shai Hulud.

**Perk:** Thumper adds a ball once per desert power multiball.

### <span id="heading--rescue"></span>Rescue

Rescue crew members by hitting lit targets then shoot the scoop to board the thopter!

All stand up targets are lit (7 totals) representing crew members that need rescuing. Hit 2 targets to light a hurry-up at the scoop and to send the crew to safety on a ornitopther. Once a target is hit, it will not relight.

After the first set of 2 rescues & scoop shot, the Worm will light for the mid-point cash out option.

Continuing, the Worm will let go of the ball and you have to redo the 2 targets + scoop combo 3 more times.

**Perk:** Water consumption in Harvester battle is slower.

### <span id="heading--fight"></span>Fight

Once a shot as been successfully shot twice in a row, the desert power field will be lit to drown the Worm.\
Next, shoot the scoop to extract the water of life.\
Finally, shoot the center or right ramp to receive the water of life. This is the mid-point of this mode.

If you continue, you will have to shoot all lit shots to fight back against the water of life.\
After all shots are made, center & right ramp will be lit for completing the mode.

## <span id="heading--multiballs"></span>Multiballs

### <span id="heading--desertpower"></span>Desert Power

Desert power multiball locks can be activated by hitting the Thumper bumper. After the first Desert Power multiball, you will need to hit the Thumper item drop target to reactivate the Thumper bumper for locks activation. It will be flashing between blue and green to indicate this.

Once activated, the locks will be active at the left & right orbit shots. After 2 locks, the mutiball will be qualified and can be started at the Worm with a jackpot base value of 5,000,000.

Note: By default (can be changed in the settings), Desert Power multiball will be automatically qualified if not played before ball 3 is started.

However, the jackpot base value can be increased by first sending the ball into the desert power field by using the back or front entrance. The trapped ball becomes a bash toy. Every switch hit inside the desert power field increase the jackpot base value. This also triggers the Worm to travel from the Thumper bumper to the Worm area with progress tracked on that path of inserts. So you have a limited amount of time to increase the jackpot base value before starting the multiball.

Jackpot shots are lit orange. The “side” jackpot shots can be moved one shot over by using the switch in front of the Worm area. Hit the same switch repeatedly to send the jackpot all the way to the right or left for maximum multiplier. Each step moved from the starting location will provide a multiplier (2x, 3x & 5x respectively). Shot will move back to the center after some time if the switch is not hit.

Once 3 jackpots are collected, the super jackpot phase will be qualified. To start it, you need to send a ball in the desert power field. You then need to use the other ball(s) to bash the captive ball to build the super jackpot. This will deplete a meter on screen. Once it is empty, the captive ball will be released. Collect the super jackpot at the spinner in the desert power field. Hitting it by entering the desert power field from the front will provide a 2x multiplier. The value of the super jackpot will be the value of the 3 jackpots collected combine.

Once the super jackpot as been collected, the 3 jackpot shots will be relit to do the cycle again, as long as at least 2 balls remains in play.

### <span id="heading--fedaykin"></span>Fedaykin

2-ball Multiball at the middle-right kickback lane - aka Sand Trap.

The drop target must be hit first to allow access to the Sand Trap. For the first Fedaykin multiball (FMB), only one hit is required. Each subsequent time, one additional drop target hit is required. The number required is shown by the number of lit red bars behind the drop target.

The first ball into the Sand Trap will be locked and another ball will auto-plunge. Once locked, the kickback/ball must be hit twice more to qualify the FMB, as indicated by the light bars at the Sand Trap entrance. For each FMB after the first, the number of shots into the Sand Trap increases by 1. This is locked out during Prophecy modes, as indicated by all the Sand Trap light bars being lit.

Once qualified, the FMB light will flash. Hitting the Sand Trap once more will start FMB and release the locked ball.

In Fedaykin Multiball, the Sand Trap will be lit. Shooting the Sand Trap will do three things: lock the ball, light the Sand Trap shot green, and light the Fedaykin Jackpot at the upper right ramp. Shooting the Sand Trap while lit green will release the locked ball and autoplunge an add-a-ball. This can be repeated to add-a-ball each time the sequence is completed.

The Fedaykin Jackpot is lit at the upper right ramp after shooting the Sand Trap. The first Fedaykin Jackpot only requires one hit and awards a Dune letter. Each subsequent Fedaykin Jackpot must be hit twice to score and the score increase for each jackpot awarded.

## <span id="heading--sandwalk"></span>Sandwalk Combo

3-shot combo with increasing point value award. Indicated by yellow shots once started at the left ramp, left orbit, center spinner, or right orbit.

1.  Left Ramp / Left Orbit / Center Spinner / Right Orbit
2.  Upper right ramp
3.  Scoop

The value of the Sandwalk combo increases each time it is collected.

## <span id="heading--painbox"></span>Pain box

Left outlane ball save opportunity. Is automatically available at the start of ball 2 by default. Note: a loaded Sand Snork will take precedence over the Pain Box and immediately save your ball, leaving your Pain Box to be used on a future left outlane drain.

When active, visible with the purple insert above the left outlane, will trigger the ball to be captured into the apron. Player needs to hold the action button and keep it pressed until proven worthy. Flipping both flippers at the same time results in instant failure.

A new ball will be auto-plunged and the player needs to successfully make the left ramp shot.\
If successful, the new ball will be drained by the left wireform hook. And the previously trapped ball will be launched back onto the playfield.\
If unsuccessful, you have been proven unworthy and your ball ends.

## <span id="heading--duneletters"></span>DUNE letters

You need to light all four DUNE letters to qualify each mini-wizard mode. Once a mini-wizard mode has been played, you need to relight the letters again. The mini-wizard modes (4 in total) are played in order.

Hunt Harkonnen in the blowing sand. Save as many Fremen as you can.

Making a spinner shot will clear the sand for some time, unveiling a lit shot to kill a Harkonnen soldier.\
Continue shooting spinners before making the lit shot to increase its value. The value is visible on the playfield screen.\
The lit shot will move from right to left for each X (3?) spins.\
Each time sands cover back the playfield for the same harkonnen soldier, the value per spin will decrease.\
Each subsequent Harkonnen soldier has a bigger base value per spin.

You need to kill 6 soldiers, by making the lit shot, before moving to the next phase.

After these 6 kills, the Harkonnen are retreating, head for the Sietch at the right orbit followed by the center or right ramp.

Shoot any shot (Right ramp, desert power field front or back, Center ramp) that goes into the Sietch area to save as many Fremens as you can.\
Each switch hit & spinner spin inside the desert power field will save 1 Fremen.\
Do this as many times as possible before times runs out (30 secs) for the mode completion.

### <span id="heading--liberatearrakis"></span>Liberate Arrakis

Unleash desert power on the Harkonens and Sardukar. Take down the Baron. Jackpot values are based on your performance in Desert Power and Fedaykin Multiballs.

First shot attracts 5 worms with each additional thumper shot attracting another worm. A maximum of 9 worms can be attracted this way.

Once all 9 worms are attracted, shoot the worm to ride into battle. The worm will grab the ball and rise up to deposit it onto the wireform. A 3 balls multiball will be started. All shot will be lit red for a jacpot. Collect all jackpots to progress.

Shoot for lit Harkonen shots (Red light). Sand trap will add a ball & relight all the jackpots (red shots).

After 10 soldiers have been defeated, shoot the Worm 4 times to break into the throne room. Once the 4th shot is locked underneath the Harvester, the flippers will go dead to go down to one ball. Once the remaining ball is released, a hurry up starts at the left orbit.

Once completed, the Baron has been defeated.
