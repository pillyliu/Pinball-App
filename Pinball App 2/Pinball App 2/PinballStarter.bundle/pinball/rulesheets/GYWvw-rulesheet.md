At the start of the game, you pick between the two movies which affects the modes available.

## <span id="heading--skill-shots"></span>Skill shots:

- Skill Shot: Roving flashing shot on the GROOVY targets. Plunge to hit the lit target, usually the plunger will send the ball to either of the two “O” targets. Scores 1M + 500k per skill shot.
- Super Skill Shot: Hold the left flipper and the plunger will fire at reduced power to the left flipper. Hit the random flashing shot in 5 seconds to score a super skill shot worth 2x the skill shot value.

## <span id="heading--modes"></span>Modes:

Light modes by shooting the ramps (lit white), then shoot under the right ramp to start modes. The first mode requires one ramp and every subsequent mode start after one has been completed requires an additional ramp. The captive ball changes which mode will be started if more than one mode is available.

Press the action button to start qualifying a different mode if the one lit isn’t the one you want to start. This will close the right ramp and allow the next mode to be qualified with additional ramp shots.

There are four modes per movie with a mini-wizard mode after completing two modes, and a wizard mode after completing all four. Each mode is split into two phases.

### <span id="heading--movie-1"></span>Movie 1:

#### <span id="heading--evil-awakens"></span>Evil Awakens:

- The targets raise from under the cellar and one target is lit at a time, moving from left to right. After hitting four lit targets, shoot the cellar within 10 seconds to start the frenzy phase for 30 seconds and light red shots for jackpots as you escape from Cheryl. Every four jackpots scored lights the cellar for super jackpot and resets the timer. The mode is completed if the player reaches the frenzy phase and ends whenever time runs out.

#### <span id="heading--hacked-to-bits"></span>Hacked to Bits:

- Target-shooting mode. The GROOVY drops and necklace targets are lit to hack for small points. Hit 5 of any target to start the frenzy phase for 30 seconds; alternate between left and right target banks to score hacks, or super hacks if the player hits targets that haven’t been made yet. The mode is completed if the player reaches the frenzy phase and ends whenever time runs out.

#### <span id="heading--it-wont-let-us-leave"></span>It Won’t Let Us Leave:

- Shoot the four randomly lit green shots (can include any orbit or ramp) to navigate the woods and start the frenzy phase. During the frenzy phase, you have 20 seconds to score scare jackpots at the red shots, but evil will be hunting for you and once those 20 seconds expire, the player must hide in the cellar to score a jackpot built up by the prior shots. Repeat this process of scoring scare jackpots then shooting the cellar 3 more times to complete the mode.

#### <span id="heading--undying-love"></span>Undying Love:

- Hit the two ramps to chain up Linda with a speed bonus determined by how quickly the player was able to combo the two ramps. Then shoot the cellar and hit the loop on the lower playfield to dig the grave. Digging the grave starts the frenzy phase, a 2-ball multiball as Linda comes back to life, hit red shots for jackpots and the necklace (right) standup targets to increase the jackpot value. The mode is completed when the multiball ends.

### <span id="heading--movie-2"></span>Movie 2:

#### <span id="heading--hello-lover"></span>Hello Lover (3 phases):

- phase 1- spinner makes linda dance - other shots increase value
- hit blue shots (5)
- then cellar
- hit deadites

#### <span id="heading--give-me-back-my-hand"></span>Give me back my hand (good to stack with mb):

- hit the hand 3 times
- then hit trap door for a mb
- jackpots around pf, super jackpot at hand

#### <span id="heading--chased-by-evil"></span>Chased by Evil:

- blue shots (combo based)
- 3 options to hide (cellar)
- shoot white shots

#### <span id="heading--evil-ash"></span>Evil Ash:

- hit red shots to turn them blue (good)
- then hit necklace targets

## <span id="heading--deadites"></span>Deadites:

- collect deadite (orange) arrows and then both inlanes and hitting the popped up deadites (think trolls from MM) to start double deadite multiball (stack with all other modes of the game)

<!-- -->

- Knock down the deadites and collect the jackpots behind the downed deadite

<!-- -->

- 2nd time through on deadites is deadite frenzy - good to stack with multiball

## <span id="heading--boom-stick-multiball"></span>Boom stick multiball:

- Load the shells into the shotgun to qualify by opening cellar door
- that goes to the basement (15 seconds or 3 drains) and you need to hit the lock and load shot
- listen for ready, aim, fire - hit launch button for bonus pts
- purple shots for jackpots
- load shells to light action button - which pressing lights a new jackpot
- 2nd phase you can add more balls

## <span id="heading--blood-flood"></span>Blood flood:

- 3 targets in pop bumper area
- adds a scoring multiplier on the playfield

## <span id="heading--cabin-multiball"></span>Cabin multiball (can steal locks):

## <span id="heading--other-extra-ball"></span>Other / Extra Ball:

- resetting cabin drops
- make next mystery award suck
- with more to come

## <span id="heading--good-linda-bad-linda"></span>Good Linda/Bad Linda:

- good linda gives easier mode rules but scoring will be less
- bad (evil) linda gives harder mode rules but better scoring
