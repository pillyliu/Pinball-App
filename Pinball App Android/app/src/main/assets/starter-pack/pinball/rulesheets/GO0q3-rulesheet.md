***Metallica*** was one of the first Stern releases to revitalize interest in physical pinball back in 2013 and received continuous improvement from code champion Lyman Sheats in the following years. The game is highly regarded for “Crank It Up” and the risk / reward decision making involved that shaped many more recent releases, the wide variety of multiball and mode stacking opportunities, and of course, the music & callouts courtesy of the band themselves. The game was given a re-release as an LCD-era machine in late 2024 and obtained some quality-of-life fixes along with a few new modes and rules. Learn how to rock this game here!

## <span id="heading--overview"></span>Rules Overview

- Shoot the main features (Grave Markers, Electric Chair, Coffin Captive Ball, and Snake) enough times to begin [**multiball**](#heading--multiballs) modes and make progress towards [**Crank It Up**](#heading--ciu) modes.
  - During **Crank It Up**, shoot the flashing shots to build the jackpot value. Making all four main features again during Crank It Up lights the scoop to either cash out the jackpot or continue the mode.
  - Play all 4 **Crank It Up** modes to qualify **End of the Line**.
  - Multiballs have an add-a-ball by completing pick targets and then locking a ball at the Snake.
  - Play all four multiballs to qualify **Blackened**.
- There are a number of additional [**Side Modes**](#heading--modes) that will typically start as soon as they are qualified and can be brought into any active feature.
  - Complete the four pick targets during single-ball play to start a 72 switch countdown. Once the countdown has been completed, **72 Seasons** will start and the pick targets will be worth increasing points built with every switch hit.
  - Hit all five major shots to light the scoop for **Hardwired Hurry-Up** (more shots are required to light subsequent hurry-ups). Self-destruct buttons that spot hurry-up shots or advance towards lighting the hurry-up can be earned in several ways.
  - Light all 15 items - 3 per shot - by hitting the corresponding main features. After collecting a coffin hurry-up at each shot, **Seek & Destroy** will start. Alternate between the flashing shot and captive ball to score increasing points.
  - Complete the FUEL targets enough times to start **FUEL fast scoring**. Completing FUEL also lights the piston target for **2x playfield** for 20 seconds.
- Light **resurrection** ball save by hitting the grave marker targets.
- Shoot the captive ball to light **[Extra Ball](#heading--ebs)** at the scoop.

## <span id="heading--tracklist"></span>Song Choice:

At the start of the ball the player is able to choose one of the 22 songs in the game as background music. This choice has no effect on gameplay.

Starting any feature, mode or multiball, will change background music to the associated song. Each song that corresponds to a mode has an associated **[setlist combo](#heading--luxaeterna)** described in the appropriate section.

</div>

## <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots

Plunge for the flashing rollover to score a skill shot value of 200k. The skill shot value increases by 50,000 for each skill shot made, and plunging for the right rollover awards 2x the skill shot value.

**Super Skill Shot**: Holding the left flipper disables the orbit up-post and activates the super skill shot which can be collected by shooting any major shot (including the scoop, the captive ball, the Snake, and Sparky). This typically awards 2x the value of the standard skill shot & increases their value by 100k, but there are bonus awards for making certain lanes as super skill shots:

- **Dead End Target:** Immediately qualifies [**2x Playfield**](#heading--fuel2x).
- **Scoop:** Lights [**Mystery**](#heading--mystery) (or collects it if already lit).
- **Blue Spider Arrow:** Qualifies that shot for a [**Coffin Hurry-Up**](#heading--seek) & adds 200k to the next skill shot. On Ball 1 the lit shot will be random on default settings or the left orbit on Competition mode. On subsequent balls the lit spider arrow will carry over from your previous ball (see [**Collecting Items**](#heading--items)).
- **Rollover lanes:** 2x the value of a standard skill shot (4x if you plunge to the right lane!)

## <span id="heading--multiballs"></span>Multiballs & Band Members

Multiball modes are a quick way to rack up points and **[collect items](#heading--items)** on ***Metallica***. There are six different multiball modes, four of which are mutually exclusive, and one of which is exclusive to machines with the topper installed; *one* additional multiball mode, can be started during **[Coffin Multiball](#heading--cmb)**.

During any multiball mode, completing the four pick targets lights the Snake for a timed lock + 2x playfield for 20 seconds. Scoring the timed lock also adds a ball into play the first time it has been scored during any multiball, and activates a ball saver for about 10 seconds. Playfield scoring resets to 1x once the timer expires.

All **[side modes](#heading--modes)** can be started or brought into Multiball modes and are vital to high scoring.

Starting or scoring super jackpots during Electric Chair, Grave Marker, Snake and Coffin Multiballs qualifies band members or advances their level. The total of all band members’ levels are used to determine scoring during the mini-wizard mode, **[Blackened](#heading--blackened)**, which lights at the scoop after playing all four multiballs. The maximum level for each band member is 8; their levels carry over across the entire game, and getting each member to level 8 awards a letter in UNFORGIVEN to qualify the **[super wizard mode](#heading--unforgiven)**.

### <span id="heading--ecmb"></span>Electric Chair Multiball (James)

Song: *Creeping Death* (odd-numbered multiballs), *Ride the Lightning* (even-numbered multiballs)

**Starting Multiball**\
Shoot Sparky 10 times to light **[electric chair inserts](#heading--items)** at the major shots and start Electric Chair Multiball. Shots to either side of Sparky score 1 hit, while shots to the target in between them score 2 hits instead. When one shot is remaining, Sparky will taunt you and all three inserts will strobe. Shoot Sparky once more to start multiball.

Subsequent Electric Chair Multiball attempts require three more Sparky hits than the last.

**During Multiball**\
Fill the Jacob’s Ladder by hitting lit jackpot shots. The jackpot shots are the flashing electric chair inserts on the left and right orbits, and the Sparky shot. The base jackpot value starts at 250k + (2.5k x total **[items](#heading--items)**). Once the power meter is completely full by scoring jackpots (each one counts as 10 switch hits) or collecting enough switch hits through other means, shoot Sparky for a super jackpot worth 1.5M + (5k x total **items**).

Each Super Jackpot collected electrocutes one of seven Sparky characters indicated by the colored electric chair inserts (white for the first one all the way up to red for the final one). As soon as the seventh Sparky has been electrocuted, the orbits, ramps, and Sparky are all lit for super jackpots, valued the same as before, for this and for every subsequent Electric Chair Multiball during the game.

Level up **James** by starting this multiball, or scoring super jackpots during the multiball.

### <span id="heading--gmmb"></span>Grave Marker Multiball (Robert)

Song: *Master of Puppets*

**Starting Multiball**\
Each shot to the inline drop targets increases your **[bonus multiplier](#heading--bonus)**, advances towards lighting **[resurrection](#heading--resurrection)** ball save, and lights a **[grave marker insert](#heading--items)** at a random shot. Once all 3 drop targets have been knocked down, shoot the grave marker target behind them to start multiball.

If any of the drop targets were hit during a different multiball, when you are back to single ball play, the drop targets will reset when it is safe to do so if the number of drop targets physically down exceeds the number of drop targets you’ve hit during single ball play.

Subsequent Grave Marker Multiball attempts require one more grave marker target hit than the last.

**During Multiball**\
All four ramps and orbits major shots are lit for jackpots that start at 200k + (2.5k x total **items**). Shooting the grave marker target itself scores a larger jackpot worth 250k at base value, and relights all shots for jackpots.

Once you have scored four jackpots at any shot, the grave marker target will strobe for double jackpot. Scoring the double jackpot will cause the magnet to hold the ball for 20 seconds. The ball can then be knocked off the magnet to score the super jackpot (1.25M + 2.5k x total items). While the ball is being held, hitting three *unique* jackpot shots will increase the super jackpot multiplier by +1x to a maximum of 5x. The super jackpot multiplier is maintained for the rest of the game, but will only increase when the super jackpot isn’t scored.

After the super jackpot has been collected, the number of jackpots required to qualify subsequent double jackpots increases by 1 for the rest of the current multiball.

Level up **Robert** by starting this multiball, scoring double jackpots at the magnet, or scoring super jackpots during the multiball. Multiplied super jackpots (using the method described above, not through any other means) add +1 level per multiplier.

### <span id="heading--smb"></span>Snake Multiball (Kirk)

Song: *Sad But True*

**Starting Multiball**\
Shoot the Snake when lit to spot letters in SNAKE. The Snake unlights once a letter has been collected, and can be relit by either hitting the snake’s mouth or shooting any shot with a lit **[Snake insert](#heading--items)** - three of these inserts light each time you shoot the Snake. Once SNAKE has been completed, the next shot to the Snake will start 2-ball multiball.

For subsequent Snake Multiball attempts, the snake mouth can only be opened by hitting it directly rather than making a lit Snake insert shot.

**During Multiball**\
Jackpots are lit at all major shots and the Snake itself, worth 300k + (3k x total **items**). Hitting any shot other than the snake adds a +1x multiplier to the “Snake Combo”, which is collected at the Snake and scores the current jackpot value times the multiplier. The Snake Combo value maxes at 3x.

Collect 5 Snake Combo jackpots to light all shots for super jackpots, valued at 750k + (2.5k x total items).

Level up **Kirk** by starting this multiball, or scoring super jackpots during the multiball.

### <span id="heading--cmb"></span>Coffin Multiball (Lars)

Song: *For Whom the Bell Tolls*

**Starting Multiball**\
Every shot to the captive ball collects **[coffins](#heading--items)** and counts down towards locking a ball at the Coffin magnet. 5 captive ball hits are required to light the first lock, then 10 hits for the second lock, and finally 15 hits for the third lock.

The number of coffin hits for each captive ball shot can be increased in different ways; rolling through the return lanes lights the captive ball for 2 coffin hits, and making **[combos](#heading--combos)** before completing them at the captive ball awards 1 coffin hit for each shot made in the combo.

As soon as the third ball is locked, Coffin Multiball begins.

**During Multiball**\
Coffin multiball is unique among the multiball modes in ***Metallica*** because it allows players to bring in one additional **[multiball mode](#heading--multiballs)** while it is running.

Jackpots are available during this multiball by alternating between the captive ball and the flashing shots for 400k + (4k x total **items**). Once all of the flashing shots have been made one time each, the next flashing captive ball shot will score a super jackpot worth 3M + (10k x total **items**) in place of the normal jackpot value.

Level up **Lars** by starting this multiball, or scoring captive ball jackpots during the multiball.

### <span id="heading--fmb"></span>Frantic Multiball

Song: *Frantic*

**Starting Multiball**\
Frantic Multiball is lit at the piston target after collecting 10 pairs of **[setlist combos](#heading--luxaeterna)**, by collecting the combos during the modes that they correspond to. More information on setlist combos can be found in their respective section.

This multiball is mutually exclusive and cannot be started during any other multiball.

**During Multiball**\
Frantic is a 4-ball multiball where all five major shots are constantly changing color between five different colors as they are hit (white - yellow - blue - green - pink - back to yellow). If two or more shots are lit in the same color, they will score jackpots worth 10x the current shot value and increase the base shot value with each jackpot made.

If at least three shots are the same color, then the piston target will light to score a super jackpot worth the total of all jackpots prior (excluding the **[2x playfield multiplier](#heading--fuel2x)**) and adding a ball into play, to a maximum of 3 times. The super jackpot is multiplied by the number of shots with a matching color minus 2.

### <span id="heading--topper"></span>And Justice for All Multiball (Topper Exclusive Mode)

Song: *…And Justice for All*

**Starting Multiball**\
This multiball can only be started if the topper is installed. During the **[Lady Justice](#heading--justice)** side mode, hitting the flashing shots will spell out METALLICA using the topper lights if the player isn’t currently in a **[Crank it Up](#heading--ciu)** mode or other **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** mode that isn’t coffin multiball. Spell METALLICA by hitting enough shots to start the multiball.

For the first Lady Justice mode, fast flashing shots will add 2 letters and other lit shots will add 1 letter. The difficulty of spelling METALLICA on the topper increases each time the multiball is started.

**During Multiball**\
And Justice for All multiball’s rules are comparable to that of the side mode that was used to start it. The left and right shots alternate for jackpots and double jackpots respectively, with each single jackpot adding 1 letter to METALLICA and each double jackpot adding 2. Once three jackpots have been scored, the next shot to either ramp will score a super jackpot and add a ball to the multiball (one time per multiball only). The next super jackpot will then require 1 more additional shot to light, to a max of 6 shots.

The super jackpot multiplier increases by +1x every time METALLICA is spelled during the multiball. However, as soon as a super jackpot is scored, the multiplier and the super jackpot value will reset; though any letters in METALLICA that were collected will remain.

## <span id="heading--ciu"></span>Crank It Up

These are the game’s main single-ball modes, which have the potential for huge scores if players are willing to put up with the risk of keeping the ball alive. Crank It Up lights at the scoop after collecting 12 of each **[item](#heading--items)** +1 per Crank It Up played during the same game. A **[fifth Crank It Up mode](#heading--eotl)** awaits players who make it through all four.

### <span id="heading--items"></span>Collecting Items

To light the scoop for **[Crank It Up](#heading--info)**, 12 (+1 per subsequent mode) of the four items must be collected:

- **[Electric Chairs](#heading--ecmb)**
- **[Grave Markers](#heading--gmmb)**
- **[Snakes](#heading--smb)**
- **[Coffins](#heading--cmb)**

There are three ways to collect the former three items - either by making direct shots to their corresponding feature on the playfield, *or* by shooting the corresponding insert at any of the five major shots, *or* by using a **[self-destruct button](#heading--button)** which collects one item per lit insert and 1 coffin for each full column of 3 inserts. The inserts light by shooting their respective features, and the blue spider arrow determines which shot the insert will be placed on. If all three inserts are on a single shot, the next shot made there will start a **[Coffin Hurry-Up](#heading--seek)**.

Coffins can only be collected by making direct shots to the captive ball, or by using the **self-destruct button** with a full column of items lit. The left inlanes light the captive ball for 2 hits for a limited time. You can also score more captive ball hits per shot by shooting **[combos](#heading--combos)**; finishing a combo off at the captive ball (ie. hitting it within 2 seconds of the last combo shot) will add one captive ball hit for each shot made in the combo.

Crank It Up lights at the scoop as soon as the required items have been collected and the player has returned to single-ball play, indicated by a unique sound / display and the 4 item inserts above the flippers pulsing.

Shoot the scoop, and then choose from any of the four Crank It Up modes (that haven’t been played yet) using the flipper buttons - or a relatively low amount of points (5M + 1M per subsequent mode) instead of starting it.

### <span id="heading--info"></span>Crank it Up Mode Information

The goal of each Crank It Up mode is to score as many points as possible by shooting flashing shots, then cashing them out at the scoop. These are *long* modes (averaging around 6 minutes each!), so take your time - but remember that ball save is only active for the first few seconds of the mode. A “completion bonus” is scored after making enough shots during the mode, collected right away and added to the jackpot. Scoring the completion bonus adds one letter to UNFORGIVEN to qualify the **[super wizard mode](#heading--unforgiven)**, and enables victory laps for the rest of the mode.

During any Crank It Up mode, making a direct shot to each of the four main features described above will light the scoop to either collect the current jackpot value (L flipper), or continue the mode (R flipper).

Scoring **[Mystery](#heading--mystery)** during any Crank It Up mode always awards “Crank It Up Bonus”, regardless of level. This collects the next lit shot you need for the mode and any increments that might have been awarded otherwise.

If the jackpot has been cashed out, the player can re-collect 25% of the jackpot value by making all five spider arrow shots, followed by the scoop to cash it out. This feature remains active until the ball drains or the next Crank It Up mode is lit by **[collecting enough items](#heading--items)**.

All **[side modes](#heading--modes)** can be brought into Crank It Up, or in the case of **[FUEL fast scoring](#heading--fuel)**, started during the mode.

The Crank It Up modes, from left to right, are as follows:

- **For Whom the Bell Tolls**: The five major shots’ item inserts are lit for jackpots. Make three shots to all five to score increasing jackpot values and light their inserts. Completing “columns” or “rows” of inserts scores even higher jackpot values. Lighting all 15 inserts scores the **Completion Bonus.** (**Crank It Up bonus** will make the next shot collect all inserts at its lane.)
- **Fade to Black**: Switch hits add to the jackpot value, which is collected at a random flashing shot or by collecting 20 switch hits. Solidly lit shots score a portion of the jackpot value. Fill the vertical progress bar on the screen through any combination of jackpots and switch hits to score the **Completion Bonus.** (**Crank It Up bonus** will reduce the switch hits required for the next jackpots by 2 to a maximum of 5.)
- **Battery**: Shoot Sparky over and over to score increasing amounts of points and light the electric chair inserts at other shots for jackpots. Hitting the ramps & orbits increases the value of the next Sparky hit, with one random flashing shot that resets when Sparky is hit increasing the value by 2x. Make 12 shots to Sparky to score the **Completion Bonus**. (**Crank It Up bonus** will light all five shots for 2x advances.)
- **Enter Sandman**: Three randomly selected inserts on each of the five major shots will be flashing, which alternate shots with *every* switch hit. Making any shot with a solidly lit insert scores a jackpot, which can be doubled or tripled if more than one lit insert is on that shot. Light all 15 of the inserts solid to score the **Completion Bonus.** (**Crank It Up bonus** will add one insert).

## <span id="heading--modes"></span>Side Modes

Side modes can be started at *any time*, even during **[multiball modes](#heading--multiballs)**, so long as **[Crank it Up](#heading--ciu)** isn’t currently running. Many side modes have ways to extend their timers, allowing them to potentially last for much longer than their initial timers.

### <span id="heading--72"></span>72 Seasons

Complete the four pick targets to light **[super spinner](#heading--spinner)** and qualify progress towards this frenzy mode (additional completions are required for subsequent 72 Seasons plays). Once the targets are completed, making 72 switch hits will start **72 Seasons**. Completing the pick targets again during the switch countdown will boost the value of each switch during the mode by an additional 25k. The switch countdown is de-activated and can’t be advanced during any multiball.

Once 72 Seasons starts, a 72-second timer will start and all four pick targets will be lit to score toy jackpots worth a minimum of 200k. Each switch hit adds 50k to the jackpots (+50k if you were able to complete the pick targets multiple times prior). The jackpot value will not reset until the mode ends (after all four targets are hit).

Hitting all four targets during 72 Seasons also awards a **[self-destruct button](#heading--hardwired)** use.

### <span id="heading--hardwired"></span>Hardwired Hurry-Up

Hit all five shots with hardwired inserts (the ramps, orbits, and grave marker targets) during single-ball, non-mode play to light the scoop to start **Hardwired Hurry-Up**. Continuing to hit shots with hardwired inserts flashing before shooting the scoop will increase the value for each hurry-up during the mode by 400k per shot.

Once Hardwired starts, all five shots will be lit to score a hurry-up value starting at 5M + any boosts prior, decreasing over time. Collecting each shot scores the hurry-up value and resets. The fifth, final shot of each Hardwired hurry-up is called the Hardwired jackpot and starts at the sum total of all four prior hurry-ups that were scored. Scoring the Hardwired jackpot also awards a **[self-destruct button](#heading--button)** use at the action button, which either advances towards lighting Hardwired, or scores a hurry-up when the mode is running.

### <span id="heading--luxaeterna"></span>Setlist Combos / Lux Aeterna

There are 14 unique setlist combos in the game that can only be earned when certain modes are running. The combos, modes they’re associated with, and the values they add to the **[combo jackpot](#heading--combos)** are listed below.

Setlist combos

<div class="md-table">

</div>

Each setlist combo earned during the mode that matches it will award a **[self-destruct button](#heading--button)** and count down towards lighting Lux Aeterna at the piston target. 5 setlist combo pairs are required to light this side mode, and it can only be started if no other multiball or Crank it Up mode is running. Collecting 10 setlist combo pairs will instead light the piston target for **[Frantic Multiball](#heading--fmb)**, and collecting all 14 pairs will award a letter in **[UNFORGIVEN](#heading--unforgiven)**.

**Lux Aeterna** is a combo-based mode with ball save for its entire duration, which starts at 60 seconds and resets every time you advance a level but gets 5 seconds removed each time the ball drains. The goal of the mode is to score as many combos as possible, starting at 5x their normal value, and increasing by +1x for each level advanced. Advancing a level requires a combo of a certain length to be made: 2-way for the first two levels, 3-way for the next three levels, 4-way for the next four levels, etc.

If the mode timer is under 10 seconds, shooting a combo will reset the timer back to 10 seconds even if it doesn’t complete the current level.

### <span id="heading--fuel"></span>FUEL Fast Scoring

Shoot the FUEL targets four times to add to the FUEL gauge, displayed in the center of the playfield, and light the dead end target behind them for **[2x Playfield](#heading--fuel2x)**. Once the FUEL gauge is completely full (after three completions of FUEL for the first attempt), the next shot to any of the targets will start the **FUEL frenzy**.

This frenzy mode allows the player to rack up big points so long as they maintain their fuel gauge. Every switch hit scores a value that starts at 5k. Direct shots to the FUEL target add time to the mode, increases the switch value by 1k (to a max of 15k) and lights the piston target for fuel jackpot (750k + 50k each time it is earned). The frenzy ends when the player’s FUEL gauge runs out, though there is a lengthy grace period to keep it running.

Further FUEL frenzies during the same game require one additional completion of the FUEL targets to qualify.

### <span id="heading--justice"></span>Lady Justice

Every shot to the left and right ramps scores a letter in METALLICA (2 letters are earned by making the ramp shots as **[combos](#heading--combos)**). Once the word has been completed with 9 shots, shoot either ramp again to begin **Lady Justice**. METALLICA letters can also be scored from random **[mystery awards](#heading--mystery)**.

The goal of Lady Justice is to attempt to “balance the scales” by alternating shots between the left and right sides of the playfield. The value for the next shot on either side of the playfield is displayed on the DMD, starting at 750k (+250k each time the mode is played) and increasing by 50k for each shot made there. Alternating shots between both sides of the playfield scores the current value plus 500k (+250k each time the mode is played). The orbit up-post is disabled during this mode.

Making any shot if the timer is under 15 seconds resets the timer to that value.

If the **topper** is installed, and the player isn’t in a **[Crank it Up](#heading--ciu)** or non-coffin **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** mode, each shot adds letters to the topper to re-spell METALLICA, with fast-flashing shots scoring 2 letters and flashing shots scoring 1 letter. Once METALLICA is spelled again, **[And Justice for All multiball](#heading--topper)** will start.

### <span id="heading--seek"></span>Coffin Hurry-Ups / Seek & Destroy

Seek & Destroy starts as soon as all five **Coffin Hurry-Ups** have been collected at the captive ball.

**Coffin hurry-ups** are started by lighting all three **[items](#heading--items)** at any of the five major shots, then shooting the shot with the strobing inserts. They can also be automatically qualified through one of the **[super skill shots](#heading--skillshots)**. Hurry-ups start at 750k + 50k x the total of all non-coffin items’ shot levels, which increase as shots with the blue arrow *and* an item insert on it are made. The value increases by 750k x the number of active hurry-ups, if multiple hurry-ups are active at once. Once a hurry-up is scored, the three items at the shot that was used to start it will be locked in and won’t disappear until Seek & Destroy starts.

**Seek & Destroy** is a potentially lucrative mode that can last a long time if you keep making the required shots. One randomly determined shot is lit to “seek” and score a jackpot worth 1M + 25k (+250k each time Seek & Destroy is played), while the remaining shots are solidly lit to score mini jackpots worth 50% of the jackpot value. Once the required shot has been made, shoot the captive ball to “destroy” and score 500k + the sum of all previous jackpots & mini-jackpots (+100k each time the mode is played). Rinse and repeat until the timer runs out (making required shots resets the timer to 15 seconds if needed).

All lit shots during Seek & Destroy add 1 of each item towards qualifying the next **[Crank it Up](#heading--ciu)** mode if it isn’t already lit.

## <span id="heading--other"></span>Other Scoring:

### <span id="heading--fuel2x"></span>2x Playfield

Every completion of the **[FUEL targets](#heading--fuel)** lights the dead end target for 2x playfield for 20 seconds. This multiplier is additive with the 2x playfield from the **[snake add-a-ball](#heading--multiballs)**, meaning 4x scoring is possible during all multiball modes with both playfield multipliers active.

The 2x playfield timer can be reset by hitting the dead end target again while 2x playfield is already running.

### <span id="heading--blownpistons"></span>Dead End Lane, Blown Pistons & Super Pistons

Blown pistons are lit at the dead end lane by hitting the bumpers - 10 hits are required per bumper. When the five rollover lanes that light **[mystery](#heading--mystery)** are completed, progress towards lighting blown pistons is temporarily doubled (starts as soon as the first bumper is hit and lasts 20 seconds, reset with bumper hits).

Up to three blown pistons can be lit at a time; continuing to hit the bumpers when any piston is solidly lit will level up the piston insert and start it flashing. Normally up to 3 pistons can be earned per dead end lane shot, but if all 3 are flashing, then 6 will be scored. Each dead end lane shot with a piston lit also scores 100k + 250k x total awards pending (up to 7 awards per red bumper), x2 if all 3 are flashing.

Blown pistons are used to collect various awards throughout the game:

- 3, 13, 23, etc.: Awards a **[self-destruct button](#heading--button)** use
- 8, 18, 28, etc.: **[Hold Bonus X](#heading--bonus)**
- 15, 40, 80, etc.: Light **[Extra Ball](#heading--ebs)**

### <span id="heading--spinner"></span>Super Spinner

Light the orbits for **super spinner** by completing the four pick targets (the same ones that are used to start the switch countdown for **[72 Seasons](#heading--72)**, or light the snake add-a-ball during any **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** mode.) Super spinner is indicated by an orange light at both orbits.

Super spinner lasts for as long as the spinner session lasts and awards 100k per spin + 5k per target completion (+25k if the targets were completed from left to right). The orbit up-post will always lower if super spinner is lit to guarantee a full orbit shot.

Super spinner can be lit at any time during play, but not during **[Blackened](#heading--blackened)** or **[End of the Line](#heading--eotl)**, though its value can still be increased by hitting the targets as normal.

### <span id="heading--resurrection"></span>Resurrection (Ball Save)

**Resurrection** is lit at both outlanes after hitting the **[grave marker drop targets](#heading--gmmb)** enough times. The first Resurrection of a game requires 3 targets, increasing by 3 for each subsequent lighting up to a max of 12.

Hitting a grave marker drop target as part of a **[combo](#heading--combos)** will award additional hits towards Resurrection based on the combo length.

The first time Resurrection is used in a game, both outlanes are lit separately from each other. Afterwards, however, draining down one lit outlane will unlight both of them.

### <span id="heading--button"></span>Self-Destruct Buttons

**Self-destruct buttons** are used by pressing the action button when flashing. When pressed, all currently lit **[items](#heading--ciu)** are collected (with one coffin awarded for each column of 3 items), and progress is made towards **[Hardwired Hurry-Up](#heading--hardwired)**, either advancing a shot towards starting it or collecting a hurry-up if the mode is running.

There are many different ways to earn self-destruct button uses and a maximum of 3 can be earned at a time, at which point the action button will start flashing red / orange to indicate that you should use one if you want to earn more:

- Scoring all 4 toy jackpots during **[72 Seasons](#heading--72)**
- Making all five shots during **Hardwired Hurry-Up**
- Collecting a **[setlist combo](#heading--luxaeterna)** during its appropriate song
- After scoring enough **[blown pistons](#heading--blownpistons)** (3, then every 10 after)
- Level 3 or 4 **[mystery award](#heading--mystery)** (2 are awarded at level 4)
- Scoring a super jackpot during **[Blackened](#heading--blackened)**

### <span id="heading--combos"></span>Combos & Combo Jackpot

Shooting shots that flow into each other consecutively without missing will award combos, indicated by the flashing red arrows. Combos also increase the progression towards specific features if they are the last shots made in the combo:

- Dead-end lane - **combo jackpot** is awarded. Starts at 750k each ball and remains boosted by 2-way combos until collected, at which point it resets to 750k + 250k x number of shots made in the combo chain before hitting the dead-end lane, each time it is scored. See the **[setlist combo](#heading--luxaeterna)** section for info on how the combo jackpot is boosted.
- Grave marker targets - progress towards lighting **[Resurrection](#heading--resurrection)** ball save is advanced by the number of shots in the combo.
- Left and right ramps - 2 **[METALLICA letters](#heading--justice)** are awarded for each ramp shot made in the combo.
- Captive ball - **[coffin](#heading--cmb)** item hits and lock progress are advanced by the number of shots in the combo.

Each combo scores points on its own as well: 250k + 500k x (combo length greater than 2-way) + 7.5k x (number of combo sequences before this one, this ball).

**[Extra Ball](#heading--ebs)** is lit after shooting 15, then 50, then every 50 combos after that.

### <span id="heading--mystery"></span>Mystery

Complete all 5 rollover lanes (3 inlanes, 2 above pop bumpers), which alternate with the flippers, to enable **[super pistons](#heading--blownpistons)** and light Mystery at the scoop. Complete them multiple times for better awards, up to level 4. Shoot scoop when Mystery is lit to collect a random award. A full set of the mystery awards and which levels they correspond to can be seen below:

Mystery awards & levels

| **[Hold Bonus X](#heading--bonus)** | N | N | N | Y |

</div>

The mystery animation can be skipped by pressing both flippers.

During **[Crank It Up modes](#heading--ciu)**, Mystery always awards “Crank It Up Bonus”, worth the value of the next required shot and any associated bonuses. The mystery level does not effect this award.

### <span id="heading--ebs"></span>Extra Balls

Extra Balls can be lit to collect at the scoop by:

- Shooting the captive ball 10, then 50, 100, etc. times (first extra ball is percentage-based and can be as low as 5)
- 15, 50, 100, etc. [**Combos**](#heading--combos)
- 15, 40, 80, etc. [**Blown Pistons**](#heading--blownpistons)

If the extra ball cap has been reached, extra ball awards 2.5M.

### <span id="heading--bonus"></span>End-of-Ball Bonus

Bonus is determined by calculating the number of **[items](#heading--items)** the player has collected over the course of the game, multiplied by the bonus X (which increases with shots to the **[inline drop targets](#heading--gmmb)**).

The bonus multiplier can be held by scoring enough **[blown pistons](#heading--blownpistons)** (8, 18, 28, etc.) or as a rare level 4 **[mystery award](#heading--mystery)**.

## <span id="heading--wizard"></span>Wizard Modes

### <span id="heading--blackened"></span>Blackened (Mini-Wizard Mode)

Light the scoop for this mini-wizard mode by playing all four **[multiball modes](#heading--multiballs)** - electric chair, grave marker, snake, and coffin - in the same game. If **[Crank it Up](#heading--ciu)** is also lit at the scoop, the player will be prompted to choose between the two modes, with the left flipper starting Crank it Up and the right flipper starting Blackened.

Sparky’s had enough of the band shocking him and gives them a taste of their own medicine. This 4-ball multiball starts by tallying up the total level of each band member and calculating the jackpot based on them. The jackpot starts at 800k, and is increased by 100k x the total levels of all band members. Band members at **level 8** correspond to:

- 1 member - 1 add-a-ball button
- 2 members - 1 add-a-ball button, 1 additional ball at the start of multiball
- 3 members - 2 add-a-ball buttons, 1 additional ball at the start of multiball
- 4 members - 2 add-a-ball buttons, 2 additional balls at the start of multiball

During the multiball, all playfield scoring is multiplied by the balls in play minus 1 (ie. the maximum that can be obtained is 5x with 6 balls in play). All shots are lit red for awards that build the super jackpot, but only one shot is lit purple to score the jackpot value, which starts at the far left of the playfield (dead-end target) and moves to the right either when it is hit or when the captive ball is shot. Hitting the flashing purple shot relights the red award shots, and “blackens” the shot that was made (further shots to them will add 250k to the jackpot). Turning all six shots purple will score the super jackpot, award a **[self-destruct button](#heading--button)**, and award a letter in **[UNFORGIVEN](#heading--unforgiven)**.

Add-a-balls are given after 3 shots have been blackened, or the super jackpot has been scored.

### <span id="heading--eotl"></span>End of the Line (Wizard Mode)

Once all 4 [**Crank it Up**](#heading--ciu) modes have been *played* (they don’t need to be completed or cashed out), collect enough **[items](#heading--items)** to light the 5th Crank it Up mode and shoot the scoop to start **End of the Line.**

At the start of End of the Line, you receive a hefty bonus for all the items you’ve collected in the game. This seems to be 200k per \# of items collected throughout your game.

Spoilers!

This wizard mode starts with 2 balls in play and 1 random shot lit for a jackpot. Collect the jackpot to light a roving super jackpot (from left to right, and then back). Once you collect the super jackpot, an add-a-ball plus ball-save is awarded and you return to the jackpot phase, but with one additional shot required to qualify your next super jackpot. You can repeat this cycle until you complete it, with all 6 shots lit for jackpots. After the final super jackpot, all shots award jackpots and no additional super jackpots are possible.

The super jackpot value is determined by 50% of the scores from the Crank It Up modes you played, awarded in order from lowest to highest, and each super jackpot includes the value of the previous ones that were scored. The 5th and 6th super jackpots “wrap around” the mode totals in the super jackpot formula, so 2x the lowest-scoring mode and 2x the 2nd lowest-scoring mode total would be added in, respectively.

Both [**Fuel 2x Playfield**](#heading--fuel2x) and [**Snake 2x Playfield**](#heading--multiballs) are in play during this multiball, so you can 2x or even 4x these Super Jackpot values!

If you drain down to single-ball play during End of the Line, the scoop can be lit for the final collect the same way that it can during the other Crank It Up modes (and it can also be qualified by completing the four features during the multiball). Scoring the final collect ends the mode and returns to normal play.

Until the player qualifies Crank It Up again, they can continue to cash out 25% of the final collect for the remainder of the ball.

### <span id="heading--unforgiven"></span>The Unforgiven (Super Wizard Mode)

This super wizard mode starts as soon as UNFORGIVEN is spelled and no other modes are currently running. Spelling UNFORGIVEN requires completion of every other major task in the game:

- Each **[band member](#heading--multiballs)** advanced to **level 8** awards a letter
- Scoring the completion bonus during any **[Crank it Up](#heading--ciu)** mode awards a letter
- Collecting 100M combined in **[fuel](#heading--fuel)**, **[lady justice](#heading--justice)**, and **[seek & destroy](#heading--seek)** awards a letter
- Scoring all 14 **[setlist combo pairs](#heading--luxaeterna)** awards a letter
- Collecting 100 **[combos](#heading--combos)** awards a letter (+100 for every time this super wizard mode is played)
- Scoring the super jackpot during **[Blackened](#heading--blackened)** awards a letter

Spoilers!

- **Part I**: Shoot spinners for big points. Once you make 72 spins, the 72 Seasons targets will light for a jackpot. Each spin increases in value until you haven’t hit a spinner in 5 seconds, then resets in value (and unlights if you’ve reached the next jackpot threshold). The toy jackpot at the 72 Seasons target is worth more depending on how many 72 Seasons toys you’ve collected.
- **Part II**: Shoot lit shots to score Hardwired hurry-ups. Make shots with a flashing Hardwired circular insert on them to add a multiplier to the hurry up value for big points!
- **Part III**: All shots start with Electric Chair inserts blinking. Shoot the grave marker to change inserts to Grave Markers, or Snake jaw to change the inserts to Snakes. Shooting a shot with a blinking item insert will award the item jackpot and turn that flashing insert solid. The base value of the item jackpot increases each time you make any item shot with solidly lit items already at that shot. The jackpot increases more if there are more solidly lit items on a shot. The item jackpot also gains a multiplier by how many items you have already made on that shot. Every column of items completed, or every 10 hits to the coffin, will add a ball into play. The coffin scores increasing millions of points until you reach 50 hits, then the coffin will unlight. Turn all item shots solid and make 50 coffin hits to light the coffin magnet to hold the ball for 9 seconds. Knock the ball off the coffin to score super jackpot and advance to victory laps.
- **Victory Laps**: Each shot starts lit for the item jackpot value, and unlights once hit. Make all 6 shots to increase the jackpot multiplier (up to 3x) and light the scoop for super jackpot. Scoring a super jackpot will add a ball and reset the jackpot multiplier.
