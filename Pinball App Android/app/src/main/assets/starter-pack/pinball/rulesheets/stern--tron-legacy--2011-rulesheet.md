## DMD Display & Timers

Tron uses a split-screen display with player scores on the left and animations on the right. In addition, the left third of the display is used to show gameplay information.

At the bottom of the left third are **three horizontal timer bars**, each made of ten dots. These represent the **three timed T-R-O-N modes**. When a timed mode starts, its bar becomes brighter and gradually shortens as time runs out. There is no text labeling which bar belongs to which mode.

The same timing system appears in the **vertical divider** between the score and animation areas. Two of the three timed modes use this divider:
- **Clu** occupies the top ten dots.
- **Gem** occupies the middle ten dots.

The bottom ten-dot strip is unused in the Pro model. Zuse Fast Scoring is timed, but does **not** use a timer bar.

<a id="heading--rules"></a>
## Rules

Tron’s rules are structured around a **central progress ladder** on the playfield. This ladder represents the major characters, battles, and objectives from the film, culminating in the wizard mode.

Insert behavior:
- **Flashing insert** = feature started / partially completed  
- **Solid insert** = feature fully completed  

This is the reverse of many earlier Stern games.

<a id="heading--skillshot"></a>
## Skill Shot

Tron has **three skill shot options**, none of which are explicitly labeled on the display.

### Flynn’s Arcade Skill Shot
Soft plunge so the ball rolls through the one-way gate at the end of the shooter lane and deflects into **Flynn’s Arcade (scoop)**.

- Scores **500,000**
- Increases by **+50,000** per successful collection

### Left Ramp Skill Shot
If the ball rolls past the scoop divider and crosses the skill-shot switch, a shot to the **left ramp** scores:
- **250,000**
- Increases by **+50,000** each time

### Upper Flipper / Right Ramp Skill Shot
Hold the **left flipper button** before plunging to keep the pop-up post lowered. The ball travels to the **upper flipper**.

Shoot the **right ramp** to score:
- **300,000**
- Increases by **+50,000** each time

Additional effects:
- **Scoop skill shot**: collects a lit Mystery Award
- **Left ramp skill shot**: collects a lit Light Cycle insert
- **Right ramp skill shot**: collects a lit Light Cycle insert

<a id="heading--mystery"></a>
## Mystery Award

Mystery Awards are collected at **Flynn’s Arcade** when lit. The scoop is lit for Mystery at the start of each ball.

To re-light Mystery, shoot the **right orbit**. One shot is sufficient. Mystery may be collected during multiball.

- 500,000 points
- Advance Recognizer
- Complete Recognizer
- Advance Quorra
- Start Quorra
- Advance Clu

<a id="heading--wizard-mode"></a>
## Wizard Mode

Tron has two wizard-related stages:
- **Sea of Simulation** (sub-wizard mode)
- **The Portal** (main wizard mode)

Which one you reach depends on how many progress ladder inserts are **solidly lit**.

If **any inserts are still flashing**, the scoop starts **Sea of Simulation**.  
If **all required inserts are solid**, Sea of Simulation is skipped and the game proceeds directly to **The Portal**.

---

<a id="heading--sea-of-simulation"></a>
## Sea of Simulation

Sea of Simulation is a **single-ball mode** designed to help complete unfinished ladder features.

### Entry Awards
At the start of Sea of Simulation, the game awards **bonus points based on how many ladder inserts are already solidly lit**.

Awards are given **in ladder order from bottom upward**:
- 1st solid insert: **1,000,000**
- 2nd: **2,000,000**
- 3rd: **3,000,000**
- And so on…

The sequence stops when it reaches a ladder insert that is **not solidly lit**.

If **Double Scoring** is active, these awards are doubled.

These points are **all awarded immediately**, even though the animations play afterward.

---

### Objective
Shoot the shots corresponding to any ladder inserts that were **not solidly lit** when Sea of Simulation began.

Lit objectives:

- **Flynn** — Shoot the scoop once
- **Gem** — Shoot the Gem (inner right loop) once
- **Clu** — Shoot each Clu helmet shot once
- **Zuse** — Hit each Z-U-S-E target once
- **Quorra** — Shoot the left inner loop once
- **Disc** — Shoot each blue disc shot once
- **Light Cycle** — Shoot each Light Cycle shot once
- **Tron** — Hit each T-R-O-N target once

### Progression Scoring
As each missing insert is completed:
- Its ladder insert lights solid
- The **next million+ award** is immediately granted

Example:
If only Flynn through Clu were solid, completing Gem awards **5M**, completing Zuse awards **6M**, etc.

Scoring pauses whenever the progression reaches an insert that is still incomplete.

---

### Completion Rules
- Sea of Simulation can be played **only once per game**
- If you fail to complete all remaining inserts:
  - Any uncompleted inserts **go out**
  - They must be completed again via normal gameplay
  - Missed million+ awards are **lost permanently**

Once all required ladder inserts are solidly lit:
- The **Portal insert lights**
- The scoop begins flashing for **The Portal**

---

<a id="heading--the-portal"></a>
## The Portal

The Portal is a **four-ball wizard multiball**.

### Entry Awards
If Sea of Simulation was skipped:
- The same **million+ ladder awards** are granted at the start

Then:
- Additional **1,000,000** points are awarded
- Portal Multiball begins

---

### Portal Multiball — Stage 1

#### Shot Structure
Four major shots are initially lit with the **lowest available insert**:
- Left orbit
- Left ramp
- Right inner loop
- Right ramp

Each lit shot:
- Scores the **current shot value**
- Adds that value to the **Super Jackpot**
- Increases the shot value by **+50,000**
- Advances the insert upward on that shot

Maximum shot value: **1,500,000**

As progression continues:
- Left inner loop and right orbit are added
- Total shots required: **21**

---

#### Insert Progression per Shot
Each shot progresses through:
1. Lowest insert
2. Light Cycle
3. Disc
4. **Red Arrow**

Red Arrow effects:
- Scores current shot value
- Adds a ball back into play if any were lost
- Triggers a **very short ball saver**

---

#### Tron Modes
T-R-O-N targets remain active:
- Tron modes (especially Double Scoring) can be started
- Double Scoring:
  - Doubles shot values
  - Adds doubled values to Super Jackpot
  - Bonus remains even after Double Scoring ends

---

### Super Jackpot
After all 21 shots are collected:
- The spinning disc becomes the **Super Jackpot**
- Value equals all accumulated shot values

Collecting it ends Stage 1.

---

### Portal Multiball — Stage 2

All major shots and the spinning disc now score:
- **1,000,000** per shot

Rules:
- Continues until only **one ball** remains
- Tron modes can still be started
- Double Scoring makes shots worth **2,000,000**

Portal Multiball ends when multiball ends.

---

### Post-Portal State
After Portal Multiball:
- All ladder inserts extinguish
- Some features (Flynn, Tron) may be partially relit during Portal
- Recognizer bank remains down
- Other multiballs cannot be restarted immediately

<a id="heading--combos"></a>
## Combos

Combos are optional but can be valuable.

After making **any of the six major shots** (those with red arrow inserts), **all arrow shots flash briefly**, allowing a combo sequence to begin.

### Combo Rules
- Each successive combo shot scores combo points
- To **cash in**, shoot the **Flynn’s Arcade scoop**
- Shooting the scoop ends the combo and awards the **End of Line Jackpot**

Scoring:
- Minimum End of Line Jackpot: **500,000**
- The jackpot **builds with every combo sequence**, even if not collected
- If the ball drains **before** collecting the jackpot, the value is **lost** and resets to **500,000** on the next ball

Combo displays have **low display priority** and are often obscured by other effects. The flashing arrows are the primary indicator.

All combo scoring can be boosted by **Double Scoring**.

---

<a id="heading--end-of-ball-bonus"></a>
## End-of-Ball Bonus

The bonus system is **not** based on switch hits.

### Base Bonus
- Fixed base bonus: **50,000**
- Does **not** increase on later balls

### Progress Ladder Bonuses
Additional bonus points are awarded based on progress ladder inserts:

- **Flashing insert**: **+50,000**
- **Solid insert**: **+250,000**

Bonuses are shown and added **in ladder order**:
Flynn → Gem → Clu → Zuse → Quorra → Disc → Light Cycle → Recognizer → Tron

### Wizard Mode Bonus Carryover
- Reaching **Sea of Simulation**:
  - Adds **450,000** bonus points at the end of **every remaining ball**
- Reaching **The Portal**:
  - Adds an additional **2,250,000** bonus
  - Equivalent to the nine solid inserts required to reach it

### Bonus Multiplier
- Each shot to the **right inner loop** increases the multiplier by **+1x**
- Multiplier resets to **1x** at the start of the next ball
- Bonus values from ladder inserts **persist across balls**

### Double Scoring Interaction
- If **Double Scoring** is active when the bonus is collected:
  - Actual bonus is **doubled**
  - Displayed values do **not** reflect the doubling

Bonus points are added **after** the bonus total is displayed (or after initials entry if a high score is achieved).

---

<a id="heading--match"></a>
## Match

At the end of the game, the **Match** feature runs.

- A Light Cycle animation plays
- Two digits are revealed
- If the match number corresponds to the player’s score, a **free game** is awarded
