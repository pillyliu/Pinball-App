### Comments

The Shadow, like World Cup and a lot of great games, is a game that sort of sneaks up behind you when you're not looking. The first few games you probably won't like much. Then, for some reason, you'll play it again. While playing, it won't seem like much; but after you've stopped you'll want to play more. Then, before you know it, you'll be hooked!

This game has one of the beefiest sound systems I've heard in an arcade. If you thought STTNG was good, hold on to your hats. The sound on this is just amazing. One problem is that it's way too quiet, we have it on about 20 while other DCS games are 14-15, while the old WPC sound games get by on 8!

The animation is as good as the sound. Especially the start of multiball, and the super jackpots. Both are truly unparalleled in any other pinball I have ever seen, no matter how big the display is!

The toys are good. The lock magnet is of course the most wholly remarkable thing in the whole of the known universe. Then there's the mini-playfield, personally I think this will be more trouble then it's worth; although other players seem to like it.

A few other things to note, the Side Saucer is not one of the pissy little ones WMS likes to use. It is more like the lock holes in Dr Who. The Side Saucer seems to hold 99% of the balls, some still bounce out, (the same is true for the Battle Field popper).

The Poppers also use mechanical switches which I find odd. Although I
<u>HATE</u> optos, I think they work well on poppers. However, Shadow uses
micro-switches, rather then leaf switches (which is what poppers used before optos became so common, and the leaf switches were awful).

The game plays really well. The drains are OK, but nothing to write home about. The shots blend well together, and when you get in the groove, the game is just fantastic.

The replay animation is great. Two bullets go screaming towards each other. First you see the left one, then the right, and finally they collide with a bang (err, a thwak). When the smoke clears, the display says REPLAY!

Well done to the whole team on this. After playing it, I want to go and see the movie. This wasn't true of Demo Man, TAF or any other movie based machine.

<a id="heading--things-to-fix"></a>
### Things to Fix

This is a list of things that could improve the game:

In multiplayer games after locking a ball, there needs to be a nice big warning to tell the player the ball will come out of the lock.

In multiplayer games after locking a ball, the player should get a chance at a skill shot. Just make it that they have to shoot the Shadow Loop, or Side Saucer to collect it. Still use the left blue button to select the award.

Something MUST be done about the lower exit from the Battle Field. Balls keep getting lost, or stuck etc.

Multiball restart is really needed.

A ball-saver after locking balls is needed, <u>especially</u> when the ball
is ejected from the lock.

Starting Vengeance from a skill shot should award the right ring on the left ramp (ie: the actual skill shot), so you don't need to shoot it again in Vengeance. I know it'll make Vengeance easier, but will improve the flow of the game IMHO.

<span id="Playfield_Layout"></span>

<a id="heading--playfield-layout"></a>
### Playfield Layout

<span id="Description"></span>

<a id="heading--description"></a>
#### Description

I'll start at the bottom, and go in a clockwise direction.

Lower Flippers Standard white full length flippers.

Slingshots Standard (non trapezoid :-) ) slingshots.

In/Out lanes A letter in the word "KHAN" appears at the top of each lane. It operates as like standard Bonus X lanes. Complete KHAN to increase the bonus multiplier. It will also light Khan Multiball at the side saucer if it is not already lit. There is no kickback.

Left Mongol targets The M and O targets are in a similar position to the Turbo Boost targets in Corvette. See the section 'Mongol' for more information.

Left Orbit Standard left orbit that is not as hard as the one in STTNG, and not as easy as the one in Corvette. It is an Arrow Shot, Jackpot Shot, and the Hurry Up Shot. The orbit feeds the upper right flipper.

Left Ramp Steep metal ramp in the same place as the Time Rift targets on STTNG. The ramp splits into 2, with a player controlled diverter. This diverter is controlled with the left blue button, which is located next to the left flipper button. The ball can be fed to the left or right in-lane. This is an Arrow Shot, Jackpot Shot and the Skill Shot.

Center moNGol targets The N and G targets are on each side of the left ramp entrance. See the section 'Mongol' for more information.

Side Loop Called the Shadow Loop, it's a small orbit that is only hittable from the upper flipper (very much like Getaway). It joins the left orbit to feed the upper flipper. See the section 'Shadow Loop' in the rule sheet for more information. This is an Arrow Shot, and Jackpot Shot. The side loop goes around the Battle Filed lane, and Lock. Most of it is under the mini-playfield.

Side Saucer  
Just <u>below</u> the side loop. This saucer is shot by the upper
flipper. It awards a super jackpot (Shadow Multiball only), and starts
Khan multiball. When Khan Multiball is not lit, this saucer will start
the currently flashing scene (if Start Scene is lit), or start Final
Battle (if it is lit). You can also put a ball here during multiball to
double or triple jackpots. See the sections for Shadow multiball, and
Khan multiball for more information. It is a saucer like the ones in
Dr Who (locks), NOT like the one in Indiana Jones.

Battle Field In a similar position to the Alpha Quadrant (center) ramp on STTNG (but a little closer to the flippers) is a small lane leading to a popper. It has a drop target in front. Knock down the drop target (may be more then once) to Open the Battle Field. Shoot the popper and the ball will be popped to the mini-playfield. This is easiest from the lower right flipper. Backhanding it from the lower left is possible, and some people can actually get it from the upper flipper too. See the Battle Field for more information. This is an Arrow Shot and a Jackpot Shot. Note, the ball bounces out of the popper quite often, and usually drains.

Yellow Target Solitary stand-up target in a similar position to the clock target on Twilight Zone. This target will spot letters in Mongol. Each time Mongol is completed, an extra hit on the target it necessary to spot a Mongol letter. The white inlay next to the target will flash when it is ready to spot a letter.

The Wall An up/down target that blocks the lock. It is very much like a drop target, except it only pops up/down when the machine tells it. Hit it to light lock, and lock balls. This is in a similar position as the Disaster Drop target on White Water. (Note: A 'hit' on this target is registered by an opto slightly in front of it)

The Sanctum The coolest ball lock on the planet. Accessible only when the Wall is down. Lock balls here for the Shadow Multiball. See that section for more information. This (including the Wall) is an Arrow Shot.

NOTE: The Wall and the Sanctum are essentially the same shot. They can be considered the same unless stated otherwise....

Right Ramp Steep metal ramp (like the right ramp on Twilight Zone) in a similar position to the right ramp on STTNG. Like the left ramp it splits into two, with a player-controlled diverter. The diverter is controlled by the right blue button, which is next to the right flipper button. The ramp can feed to the left or right inlane. This is an Arrow Shot and Jackpot Shot.

Start Scene A saucer at the end of a short lane (exactly like Getaway). It awards Who Knows, Extra Ball, starts a Scene, and starts Final Battle. It is also an Arrow Shot, and generally an all 'round nice guy... The actual saucer is like the Skill Shot one on TAF. Sometimes, an odd shot to the right orbit will bounce into this hole (like on Getaway).

Right Orbit Standard orbit that is very similar to STTNG, Corvette, Getaway, etc. Balls put here will come out of the left orbit to the lower left flipper. Slow balls will dribble out of the side loop. This is an Arrow Shot and Hurry Up Shot.

Upper Flipper Same as Getaway, Star Trek etc.. Use it to shoot the Side Loop, Side Saucer, or the Battle Field .. actually it seems to be the safest way to knock that drop target down.

Right mongOL targets The O and L targets are directly opposite the M and O ones. See the section on 'Mongol' for more information.

Plunger Autoplunger, fired with a trigger similar to Indi's.

Battle Field Think Path Of Adventure from Indi, and you're close. It's in the same place, but it's more square. There are 4 beefy looking yellow drop targets down the back, and 4 stand-up targets on each side (well, the right only has three!) A bat at the bottom is controlled by the flippers (side to side) and when the ball hits it, the bat pushes it away, (think Brick Out..) The object is to score enough hits, complete the playfield, and defeat Khan. If you miss, the ball falls off the bottom, and will probably get stuck somewhere. If you succeed, the ball will be fed to the upper flipper. More information in the Rules section.

<span id="Arrow_Shots"></span>

<a id="heading--arrow-shots"></a>
#### Arrow Shots

Most of the major shots in this game are Arrow Shots:\
Left Orbit, Left Ramp, Battle Field, Wall (Sanctum), Right Ramp, Start Scene, Right Orbit, Side Loop.

<span id="Jackpot_Shots"></span>

<a id="heading--jackpot-shots"></a>
#### Jackpot Shots

Some of the major shots in this game can be lit for a jackpot:\
Left Orbit, Left Ramp, Battle Field, Right Ramp, Side Loop.

<span id="The_Cabinet"></span>

<a id="heading--the-cabinet"></a>
#### The Cabinet

The Shadow is a 5 ball game, in a standard (narrow body) cabinet.

Next to each flipper button (red), is a blue button. The left blue button controls the left ramp diverter, and the right blue button does the same for the right ramp. Pressing a blue button toggles the way the ball will be diverted. When the diverters move, they make a really cool (and loud) crunch noise..

The game is equipped with an autoplunger that is fired with a trigger much like the gun on Indi (well this is more like a slightly beefed up version). Plunged balls are fed to the lower right flipper. During the game, pulling the trigger will usually play an empty gun click sound.

There are no plastic ramps anywhere (well there's a little one up the top .. but I won't include that here..). The ramps feed gold wire-forms that stick mainly to the side of the playfield. They really don't stand out much, which I like.

The extra ball button is mounted on the cabinet below the gun, and is orange.

The artwork is amazing, especially the side of the machine. The backglass art is ok, better then STTNG and Demo Man, but not up there with Twilight.

On the playfield are three really cool knight figures, they're not all that important, but I like them!

There are no under-playfield tunnels, which means no kickouts. This is
yet <u>another</u> similarity with Getaway.

The outlanes are fine, better then any Bally/Williams machine this year. There is rubber everywhere, and the posts on our machine were right down when we got it. Even still, there are no shots on the game that cause the ball to go screaming down a side drain. This is a GOOD MOVE!

The center drain is about average. The only shot that often went SDTM was a failed left ramp. Sometimes (not all that often) a direct shot at the wall, or the Battle Field drop target flew down the drain. There is an operator adjustment for this, see Feature Adjustments number 11.

<span id="Rules"></span>

<a id="heading--rules"></a>
### Rules

<span id="Scenes"></span>

<a id="heading--scenes"></a>
#### Scenes

The modes this game are called scenes. They do not run concurrently, but any running mode will continue during multiball. During a mode you can start all other game features. Totals from each scene are added during the bonus count.

During the opening animation of any scene (except Hotel, and Duel of Wills), pulling the trigger will play some duck quacks, and the quote "Anyone for Peking Duck?". The same thing is true when you get the 2 Million Scene Bonus. For more information, see the section [Secret Laugh Mode](#Secret_Laugh_Mode).

The scenes are displayed in the middle of the playfield, lit ones have
been played, blank ones haven't, and the flashing one will be started
next. Shoot the ramps to change the currently flashing scene. Divert the
ball left to move the flashing scene <u>up</u>, divert the ball right to move
the flashing scene <u>down</u>. 'up' and 'down' refer to the way I have
listed them below.

The scenes are:

Punish the Guilty

Farley Claymore

Duel of Wills

The Beryllium Sphere

Escape Underwater Doom

Discover Hotel Monolith

They cycle in a loop, so down from Discover Hotel Monolith is Punish the Guilty, and up from Punish The Guilty is, obviously, Discover Hotel Monolith.

There is NO wizard award for completing all scenes. However there IS a wizard award...

Start Scenes at Start Scene (duh!) or the Side Saucer (only if Khan Multiball isn't lit). Start Scene is always lit if not in a scene, and not in multiball. Shooting Start Scene, (or the Side Saucer if Khan isn't lit) during a scene, will award 2 Million as a Scene Bonus.

<span id="Punish_The_Guilty">Punish the Guilty</span>  
A 30 second mode where you have to shoot the lit arrows to save Tam. Three arrow shots will be lit (Left Orbit, Side Loop, and Right Orbit). Each shot awards 10 million. Once all three have been hit, shoot Start Scene to collect 30 Million.

<span id="Farley_Claymore">Farley Claymore</span>  
Remember Q's Challenge?! A 30 second mode where you have to beat up Farley (trust me, he deserves it!). The display shows the Hit-O-Meter, which is full at the start of the mode. Every arrow (except the side loop and the Wall) is lit, and each one deducts a bit from the H-O-M. The mode ends when the timer expires, or the H-O-M is empty, about 5 or 6 shots. Not sure on the value per shot. NOTE: If the Battle Field is lit during this mode, shoot it. Every hit on the Battle Field reduces the Hit-O-Meter as well.

<span id="Duel_Of_Wills">Duel of Wills</span>  
A great video mode. Dodge the falling Phurba's to get points, or the Extra Ball. Point values start at 1 Million, after a few it becomes 3 Million, then 4 etc. It can actually get quite hard. Pull the trigger during this mode to clear the screen and leave it clear for a few seconds. Beware though, as the Phurba's return in bulk, and moving fast.

<span id="The_Beryllium">The Beryllium Sphere</span>  
You have 30 seconds to defuse a bomb. Each arrow cuts a wire. The first shot is worth 10 mill, then 12, 14 etc. Arrows do not remain lit after they have been hit, (ie: you can only hit each shot once.) You must cut six wires (therefore, make 6 shots); if you do it, shoot Start Scene for 30 Million.

<span id="Escape_Underwater_Doom">Escape Under Water Doom</span>  
Hurry up that counts down from 30 million. Shoot the lit shot to collect the current value. It will continue to count down, and another shot will light. The shots light in the following order:

Left Ramp and Right Ramp

Left Orbit

Shadow Loop

Left Ramp

When all have been collected, Start Scene will light, shoot it to complete the mode for 30 million.

<span id="Discover_Hotel_Monolith">Discover Hotel Monolith</span>  
This is a cool two ball multiball. It continues until less then two balls remain in play. Hit the wall to reveal the hotel (3 hits). The first two hits award 10 million, the third hit is worth 20 million, and the wall will pop down. Hit a ball into the Sanctum to light all arrows. The ball(s) will be unlocked, and each arrow is worth one million more than the previous (the first is 10 million). Get them all for 30 million. All arrows relight, and the value returns to 10 million. The mode ends when less then two balls remain in play. It is not possible to lock balls (for Shadow Multiball) during this mode, or start Khan Multiball. The display during the first part of this is really great.

<span id="Battle_Filed"></span>

<a id="heading--battle-field"></a>
#### Battle Field

The object of the mini-playfield is to defeat Khan. To open it, hit the drop target. Shoot the popper and the ball will be popped onto the mini- playfield. While the ball is in the popper, pull the trigger for some Peking Duck. See the section "[Secret Laugh Mode](#Secret_Laugh_Mode)" if you want to know more.

The mini-playfield has drop targets down the back, and stand-up targets on the side. When the drop targets stop popping back up, you can defeat Khan, the ball will be fed to the upper flipper.

One of the most annoying things about the drop targets, is the fact that the ball hits them so hard, they often don't fall down!

Use the flippers to control the bat, so the ball hits it. The first time you must make 30 hits (of the targets) to find Khan. Once found, knock the drop targets down to break through, and defeat him. It's actually quite satisfying.

Defeating Khan is worth 30 million the first time you do it, and 10 million more each time after. The number of hits required to defeate him goes up by 20 each time too, and maxes at 100. Finally, an extra hit on the drop target is necessary to open the Battle Field for every time Khan is defeted.

Also, each target has a light in front of it. If you manage to hit each target at least once, the value for defeating Khan goes up by 20 million for each time you do it. So if you complete all targets three times, you will be awarded 60 million on top of the Khan Jackpot.

Remember that hits on the miniplayfield count during the Farley Scene.

\[Note: A soft shot would often manage to sneak past the drop target when multiple hits were necessary. In this case the machine lets you play the mini-playfield anyway.\]

<span id="Shadow_Multiball"></span>

<a id="heading--shadow-multiball"></a>
#### Shadow Multiball

<span id="Starting_Shadow_Multiball">Starting:</span>

Shoot the wall to light lock. Lock one is lit at the start of the game. Each multiball requires one more hit of the wall to light lock.

When lock is lit, shoot the wall again to lock the ball. This is cool: a magnet grabs the ball, the Wall is lowered, and the ball is thrown into the Sanctum.

On the third lock, three ball multiball begins. Watch the opening animation, it is unbelievable... I have played the game plenty of times, and still go WOW at the lock sound/light/ball show!

Balls are ejected one at a time from the lock to the upper flipper, imagine the hidden hallway from Fun House, but on the other side of the playfield. Look closely as there is an orange flasher that makes the balls hard to see.

Since the game has an autoplunger, it is not possible to 'Steal' locked balls. If there are less then three balls in the lock at the start of multiball, the machine auto-plunges them. I don't like this one bit, as auto-plunged balls are not set up for jackpots - but what can you do?

<span id="Shadow_Multiball_Jackpots">Jackpots:</span>

The jackpot starts at 20 million. Shoot the side loop to collect. Remember the ball returns to the upper flipper, so multiple jackpots are possible, and even suggested. Balls will not be kicked out of the lock if you are on a 'jackpot roll'.

The wall stays down during this multiball (it is only lowered after all three balls have been ejected from the lock). Shoot the Sanctum to set your-self up for jackpots. This is a great feature, it also reminds me a lot of White Water. Balls will not be kicked out of the lock if you are on a 'jackpot roll'.

After 5 jackpots, the super jackpot will light at the Side Saucer. Shot it from the upper flipper for 100 million. After each super jackpot, 5 more regular jackpots are needed to relight it.

Lock a ball in Start Scene or Side Saucer to double the regular jackpot. Lock a ball in both of these places to triple the regular jackpot. Double/Triple jackpots revert to the regular value after one jackpot, or 10 seconds, the ball(s) is/are kicked out too. Note that Double Jackpot actually awards 2 jackpots, and Triple Jackpot awards 3.

The super jackpot can only be doubled by locking a ball in Start Scene, the 10 second timer still applies.

Shadow multiball ends when less then 2 balls remain in play.

<span id="Khan_Multiball"></span>

<a id="heading--khan-multiball"></a>
#### Khan Multiball

<span id="Starting_Khan_Multiball">Starting:</span>

Light Khan Multiball by completing KHAN at the in/out lanes. (Note, each completion of KHAN also advances Bonus X.) After a few Khan multiballs, the Start Khan Multiball light times out.

Khan Multiball is lit at the Side Saucer, this is not stackable. Shoot the saucer to begin the three ball multiball. \[The other two balls are auto-launched\].

<span id="Khan_Multiball_Jackpots">Jackpots:</span>

All jackpot shots start lit (not the Super Jackpot). Jackpot value starts at 20 Million (per jackpot!), and the in/out lanes add 100 thousand. See the playfield description for a list of the Jackpot Shots.

Lock a ball in Start Scene or Side Saucer to double the jackpot value. Lock a ball in both of these places to triple the jackpot value. Double/Triple jackpots revert to the regular value after one jackpot, or 10 seconds, the ball(s) is/are kicked out too.

Once all regular jackpots have been collected, then a Super Jackpot
lights on the mini-playfield! One of the drop targets will be lit in
turn (like the skill shot on Terminator 2), you must hit this for the
Super Jackpot which is worth 100 million. It's <u>hard</u> to control the
bat, and keep the other 1 or 2 balls in play. The Super Jackpot can be
doubled/tripled in the same way as the regular one. Note: if the
miniplayfield is disabled, it is not possible to get the Super Jackpot!

Khan multiball ends when less then two balls remain in play.

<span id="Final_Battle"></span>

<a id="heading--final-battle"></a>
#### Final Battle

**CAUTION: READ THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! IT MAY SPOIL THINGS FOR YOU!**

On the playfield is a Scarf (near the Side Saucer). It contains four inlays that will light during the game. Light all four to light Final Battle:

Complete Scenes - Will light when the last scene finishes, or when the ball drains during the last scene.

Conquer Battle Field - Defeat Khan at least once.

Shadow Multiball - Lights when Shadow Multiball finishes.

Khan Multiball - Lights when Khan Multiball finishes.

When the scarf is complete, Final Battle will be lit at Start Scene. Shoot Start Scene, or the Side Saucer (if Khan is not lit) to start it. Final Battle lights as soon as the scarf is complete ... yes, even during multiball (although I have never managed to start it during multiball).

The sound and lights are quite hard to describe ... but it's very, very cool. The intro goes like this:

"Congratulations. Prepare yourself, this is the Final Battle."

Four more balls will be launched into play (it's a five ball multiball
with a 30 second ball saver), and the object is to hit every shot for
1 billion. But wait - it is <u>always</u> awarded this time!

The shots are:

MONGOL targets

6

Left Orbit

Battle Field targets (anti-clockwise starting at the top left corner)

Arrow Shots

There might be a bug in here somewhere though, as the following has been observed:

1 hits remaining.

0 hits remaining.

255 hits remaining.

254 hits remaining.

1 billion.

I tried this on our machine and couldn't replicate the fault, so maybe it is caused by something else. My machine is L-2, and the one that faulted is also L-2.

Each shot is worth 10 million. The countdown is shown on the display. Note that if the drop target is busted, the machine will spot that shot for you (and award the 10 million) ... so you'll only have to get 26 shots.

If the mini-playfield has been disabled, then hit the drop target to
spot a few mini-playfield targets. God knows what happenes if the drop
target <u>and</u> the mini-playfield are broken. My guess is that no-one will
play that machine!

As soon as the last shot is hit, the machine goes dead: no sound, lights or flippers - all remaining balls drain. After a second of this comes the quote, "You're FINished Khan!" which is followed by a scream, the lights all come on, and a rap style collection of animations is played - topped off by the shot of some mirror going through Khan's head. The Billion points are awarded (you are actually awarded it too), with someone screaming ONE BILLION. Following this is the quote: "Finally you've learned to control the pinball".

After the billion, all five balls are re-launched and all shots re-light for another go. Note that there is no ball saver now, even if it haden't timed out, it will be turned of - cruel huh?! Final Battle ends when there are less then two balls left in play. The scenes all reset for another go.

Completing Final Battle (ie: getting the billion) allows you to enter you initials in the list of Final Battle Imortals, at the end of the game. This is better then it sounds, as the quote for getting in this list is just too cool to mention. If you REALLY must know, have a look in the Easter Eggs.

<span id="Vengeance"></span>

<a id="heading--vengeance"></a>
#### Vengeance

On either side of each ramp diverter is a ring. At the start of a game all rings will flash. When you shoot a ramp, the ring on the same side of the diverter that the ball went, will become solidly lit (each ring is worth 3 million). Complete all four rings to start possibly the coolest mode since Big Foot Hot Foot: Vengeance.

Vengeance is a cool 30 second mode where each ring is worth 5, 7, 9, 11, etc million. Completing all four awards 50 million, and restarts the timer. There is a very friendly grace period at the end of the mode, so you can still score Vengeance after the sound/music has stopped.

If you start Vengeance as part of a combo (ie: the combo collects the last ring), you start Combo Vengeance where each ramp is worth 10 million.

If, during Vengeance or Combo Vengeance, you get all rings in a row (ie: a combo), you are awarded 100 million as a Super Vengeance.

NOTE: What I have called Combo Vengeance, the machine calls Super Vengeance. I used the name Combo Vengeance because completing all ramps awards 50 million, while Super Vengeance awards 100 million.

Note that after you get the 50 million, the single ramp values continue to escalate. After Vengeance, all rings will start flashing again.

Remember that if you start Vengeance by a skill shot, you will need to hit the same ramp again, it does not award the ring.

<span id="Mongol"></span>

<a id="heading--mongol"></a>
#### Mongol

Around the playfield are 6 targets, each for a letter in MONGOL. These are the MONGOL targets. There are two above the left in/out lanes (M, O), two at the entrance of the left ramp (N, G) and two above the right In/ Out lanes (O, L). The single yellow standup target spots letters in Mongol, hit it once to spot a letter; an extra hit is necessary for each time Mongol has been completed. There is a white inlay next to this target that flashes when it's ready to spot a letter.

Spelling Mongol starts a hurry up. Thirty million counts down, and is collectible from the left or right orbit. The start of Mongol is easily noticable by the cool 'gong' sound effect.

Pull the trigger during the count-down to end the mode, and award 3 million points.

"Find him, and kill him. All of you .. GO!"

<span id="Who_Knows"></span>

<a id="heading--who-knows"></a>
#### Who Knows

Who Knows is a random award lit at Start Scene by spelling Mongol. Possible awards are:

Points (between 10-30 million)

Light EB

Light Khan Multiball

Start Vengance Mode

Start Mongol Mode

Bonus X

Light Lock

<span id="Skill_Shot"></span>

<a id="heading--skill-shot"></a>
#### Skill Shot

Before launching any ball (not for a ball saved ball), the display shows two choices. On the left are some points (starts at 10 Million, increases by 5 million each time and maxes out at 40 million), on the right is a real award. Choose between the two with the left blue button. The diverter on the left ramp will flip. If the ball will go right, you'll get the award, if the ball will go left, you will get the points. Shoot the ramp to actually collect it (this is what the word 'skill' means!). The good thing is that you can set the diverter to the right, plunge, and get the award without waiting for the 'Shoot Again', or 'Replay At', screens to disappear. You also don't know what the award will be until you get it!

The skill shot remains lit for about 5 seconds. During this time you can keep changing the left diverter to change what you want - yes, even after you have plunged the ball. So what you get is basically chosen by which way the ball is diverted on the left ramp. Note that if you drain and the ball is saved, the skill shot it turned off.

Note: When you start Vengeance with the skill shot, remember to shoot the right side of the left ramp again as that ring is not spotted for you.

Possible awards:

Complete Mongol

Start Vengeance

Light Lock

Light Extra Ball

Bonus X

Light Khan

5-40 Million

<span id="Combos"></span>

<a id="heading--combos"></a>
#### Combos

According to the audits, there are combos all over this game, right up to seven way combos. It is actually quite hard to hit more then three shots in a row and NOT get a combo. I'm not sure of the combo values, but the quote is the best:

"WOW! x way combo!" - where x is a number between 3 and 7 inclusive.

I just want to know how they managed to inject <u>so</u> much American accent
into this quote!!

There are also a couple of two way combos lying around the place, but they do not genorate the above quote.

<span id="Shadow_Loop"></span>

<a id="heading--shadow-loops"></a>
#### Shadow Loops

The Shadow Loop is the side loop shootable by the upper flipper. Awards are given for the number-of-loops-in-a-row you get. There is also a place in the high scores for the person who manages the most loops.

When you shoot the loop, it remains lit for a few seconds for another shot. When it's lit, you get an increasing 2 million (starts at 2 million) until you miss. Then it reverts back to 2 million.

Light Extra Ball

3 loops in a row

Shadow Bonus (40 Million)

5 loops in a row

These awards are not set in stone, they both reflex. I have seen extra balls
at 2 loops, and once at <u>7</u>!

A slow shot up any orbit will dribble out the side loop for a Secret Passage bonus, worth 5 million.

<span id="Orbits"></span>

<a id="heading--orbits"></a>
#### Orbits

There are two main orbits in the game. The left one, and right one. Each orbit is worth 1 million. Consecutive orbits are worth 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 million (maxes at 32 million). Every fourth awards the following:

4\)

China Town

5 million

8\)

Cobalt Club

10 million

12\)

Hotel Monolith

15 Million

16\)

Cranston Manor

20 Million

20\)

Mari-Tech

25 Million

20+)

Super Loops

20 Million per loop.

Number of loops does not reset each ball.

The orbit software is really buggy. It never actually awards Mari-Tech, the screen says "Mari-Tech in (x) loops", then just awards Cranston Manor again for 20 million. This is P-1 ROMs.

It also managed to get into the good ole 255 loops until Mari-Tech. Although this seems fixed in L-2 ROMs.

<span id="Secret_Laugh_Mode"></span>

<a id="heading--secret-laugh-mode"></a>
#### Secret Laugh Mode

It's good to see more hidden stuff in the games. It's even better that we manage to find it. ;-)

There are three duck quotes in this game, they all say the same thing:\
"Any-one for Peking Duck?"

The first time it is whispered (you have to listen very carefully to hear it); the second time it is said by a guy with a Chinese accent; and the third time it is said by a woman.

There are many ways to get the quote:

Pull the trigger at the start of any mode except Duel of Wills, and Hotel.

Pull the trigger at the <u>end</u> of Duel Of Wills.

During the quote: "I know" (Who Knows award).

During the Extra Ball animation.

While getting a 'Scene Bonus 2,000,000'.

Anytime the ball is in the Battle Field popper.

The trick is that you can only get the quote once from each physical location on the playfield: Side Saucer, Start Scene and the Battle Field Popper. Also make sure you don't have Mongol running, as pulling the trigger will end that mode (awarding 3 million).

To start Laugh Mode, you must have heard the quote said by all three people. The easiest way to do this is:

Start a scene (at Start Scene), and pull the trigger.

Shoot the Side Saucer, and if Khan is not lit, you'll get the 2M Scene Bonus. Pull the trigger again.

Shoot the Battle Field, and pull the trigger before the ball is popped.

Once you have heard all three quotes, start a scene like you normally would, but instead of starting one of the regular five, the display will say:

You discovered: The Secret Laugh Mode

There is also a duck (!) on the right, that quacks twice.

Laugh Mode lasts thirty seconds, and the display tells you to "Hit Anything". The music is similar to Farley .. but with constant laughter, mixed with quacking. Shooting any arraw (they are all lit) awards 5 million, and the duck quacks 5 times.

For a real (ie: good, long, hard) laugh, start multiball during this mode; the first time I did, myself and all the spectators were almost on the floor!

Laugh Mode runs like any other 'normal' scene. It is possible to lock balls, start Shadow/Khan multiballs, play the Battle Field, start Vengeance etc. The only difference is that the total from Laugh Mode is added to your score as soon as the mode ends, and not suring the bonus count. It is only possible to start Laugh Mode once per game.

<span id="Bonus"></span>

<a id="heading--bonus"></a>
### Bonus

The bonus count is mainly made up of totals from the Scenes, and it is not possible to speed it up.

Increase the bonus multiplier by completing KHAN on the in/out lanes. The multiplier starts at 2x (for the first completion of Khan), then 3x, 4x, 5x ... 10x. It maxes out at 10x and further completions of Khan award 10 million.

The bonus multiplier only multiplies the bonus before the scene totals are added in.

<span id="Extra_Balls"></span>

<a id="heading--extra-balls"></a>
### Extra Balls

Extra balls can be lit the following ways:

Lit by Skill Shot.

Lit by Shadow Loops.

Lit by Defeating Khan.

Lit by Who Knows

Collect extra balls by shooting Start Scene.

One of the items in the Video Mode is an extra ball.

Extra balls can also be bought for one credit. The operator can set the number of Buy In's from 1 to 3, default is 1.

<span id="High_Scores"></span>

<a id="heading--high-scores"></a>
### High Scores

The following high score lists exist:

Grand Champion - Highest score, no buy-ins.

Best Agents - Top 4 scores, no buy-ins.

Buy-In Grand Champion - Highest score with at least one buy-in.

Buy-In Scores - Top 4 scores with at least one buy-in.

Final Battle Imortals - Last 10 people to complete Final Battle. (When the high scores are re-set there are only 4 names in this list.)

Shadow Loop Champion - Person to achieve the most consecutive Side Loops.

<span id="Quotes"></span>

<a id="heading--quotes"></a>
### Quotes

There are some top quotes in the game:

During Farley Scene: "I'm not afraid of The Shadow!"

Start of Mongol: "Find him, and kill him. All of you, GO!"

"The sun is shining, but the ice is slippery..."\
Or as Noel Steere would say:\
"The Burger is warm, but the Fries are soggy!"

Sometimes after NOT matching: "Coward, Chicken, Sissy ... Cummon, play again!"

"Vengeance is YOURS!"

"Finally you've learned to control the Pinball!"

For a tilt: "You still think you can control the game with brute force?"

On the Battle Field: "Flippers ... Use the flippers!"

If you don't plunge for a while: "You are BORing me!"

"Anyone for Peking duck?!"

Start of Khan: "Join me, or die!"

Shooting a side of a ramp that has already been hit:\
"Use the blue buttons!"

"Concentrate!"

<span id="Misc"></span>

<a id="heading--misc"></a>
### Misc.

Matching is enabled by default, which is good because it's a cool sequence. A torch shines on a brick wall, the match number is in the small circle of light. As the torch sweeps left and right, the number changes. When a match occurs, the Shadow appears and laughs.

The knocker is way too quiet. I fixed ours tho ;-)

<span id="Feature_Adjustments"></span>

<a id="heading--feature-adjustments"></a>
### Feature Adjustments

The following game features are adjustable by an operator. The value in (brackets) is the default, and the value in \[square brackets\] is what my machine is set on if it differs from the default. When a value range is given, it is inclusive. Eg: 1-5 means the value can be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

### Game Difficulties

The following table lists the settings for the 5 possible difficulty levels. Remember that these settings are in no way fixed, and that some machines may in fact not match any standard setting. Let me explain: When an Install option is carried out, all of the settings in the below table are changed to those values. Adjustments that are missing, are simply not altered by that particular Install operation. The factory setting is of Medium Difficulty.

This is from a manual marked as 'Preliminary', so it could be totally wrong! I will check it when we get our first production machine.

### Bugs

Just a few glitches in an otherwise fine game:

During Khan Multiball, when you lock a ball to double/triple the Super Jackpot, the usual screen comes up with the 10 second timer, however the ball(s) are instantly kicked out, and the Jackpot value doesn't change. This is fixed in L-2 ROMs.

Twice during the mini-playfield test, the machine froze when the test passed (I had to power cycle). It doesn't always happen though. (P-1 ROMs). I'm assuming that it's fixed in production roms.

The display saying: '180 hits left to open Battle Field'! Fixed in L-2 ROMs.

Sometimes the machine will auto-plunge two balls (only after a ball save), it is a software bug that is fixed in L-2 ROMs.

The orbit software is really buggy. It never actually awards Mari-Tech, the screen says "Mari-Tech in (x) loops", then just awards Cranston Manor again for 20 million. (P-1 ROMs)

It also managed to get into the good ole 255 loops until Mari-Tech. This is fixed in L-2 ROMs.

For some bizzare reason, pressing just the right flipper button will abort the buy-in screen. (P-1 ROMs)

The ball can get stuck behind the Battle Field drop target, this is no real problem as when the ball search happens the drop target is lowered, which causes the ball to be pushed into the popper. The usual Battle Field screen comes up, and the ball is popped. However, the ball search is just finishing, and although the paddle flips the ball on the mini-playfield, the flipper buttons do not move the paddle. This causes the machine to think the mini-playfield is broken, and disables it until the next slam-tilt or power cycle. This has been fixed in L-2 ROMs: when the popper detects a ball, it'll always activate the mini playfield.

If you shoot the Battle Field popper when the drop target is down, you are not awarded the arrow or jackpot. This is REALLY annoying as the drop target is the same kind as STTNG, and will surly malfunction on some games. This is fixed in L-2 ROMs. Oddly enough, if the drop target is dead, it will spot the arrow for you as soon as you start Final Battle.

Sometimes the Final Battle countdown goes past zero, to 255. I'm guessing that it may be caused by the Side Saucer and/or Start Scene not spotting hits properly. (L-2 ROMs)

The game still often <u>thinks</u> the miniplayfield is dead, and only a
power-cycle or slam will get it to re-test the dam thing. What would
be reall, really cool, would be if the mini-playfield was reset at the
end of every game.

When Who Knows awards Vengeance, the screen looks really bad. The text 'VENGEANCE MODE' doesn't fit, and demolishes the pretty border.

<span id="Easter_Eggs"></span>

<a id="heading--easter-eggs"></a>
### Easter Eggs

Just some cool things to try when someone else is paying:

The cow has been found! Look closely at the score display during normal play, there is mist in the background that often forms The Shadow, or a Phurba ... very rarely it'll form a cow. 'Coolness' is not a strong enough word to describe it! Pull the gun trigger to get the cow to mooo!

A duck has been found too! Much like the cow it appears in the mist behind the score display. Pull the gun trigger to get it to quack!

In attract mode, hit the flippers to advance to the next screen (like STTNG). Hit both flippers to see the scores of the last game played.

During the video mode, pull the trigger to clear the display, and keep it clear for a few seconds. You can only do it once per video mode, and beware, when those Phurba's return, there are plently of them, and they are f-a-s-t!

The Secret Laugh Mode.

During the Mongol hurry up, pull the trigger to end the mode, and award 3 million.

Sometimes when the ball drains down an outlane, a herd of mooing cows will meander across the display - much like Black Rose.

Getting your name in as a Final Battle Imortal, yeilds the quote: "Your life is now one of purpose an honner." This quote, I believe, is even better then the billion!

<span id="Compensation"></span>

<a id="heading--compensation"></a>
### Compensation

If one of the ramp diverters die, the machine doesn't automatically turn on compensation. (There is an adjustment that can be set if either diverter is busted (Adjustments 29 and 30) - This must be manually set by the operator.)

If the Wall is stuck up, hitting it will count as a lock (L-2 ROMs) \[lighting locks is still the same\]. Although the Hotel Monolith scene won't work properly. Reavealing the hotel is possible, but it won't start the second part.

If the opto for the magenet in front of the Wall dies, the Wall will remain down then entire game. Shoot the Sanctum to light lock, and lock balls.

If the miniplayfield is broken, then hitting the Battle Field drop target (when the Battle Field is lit), will simply spot a number of hits.

If the miniplayfield is broken, there is NO way to get the super jackpot in Khan Multiball.
