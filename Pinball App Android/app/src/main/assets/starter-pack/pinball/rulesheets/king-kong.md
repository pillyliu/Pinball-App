***King Kong: Myth of Terror Island*** is the long-awaited King Kong pinball machine 35 years in the making (Data East planned one, but it went unreleased due to high production costs). The machine uses entirely original assets and primarily bases itself on the original 1930s **King Kong** novel.

# <span id="heading--layout"></span>Layout:

# <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots:

- **Skill Shot**: Plunge the ball into the pit targets.
- **Super Skill Shot**: Plunge the ball into the river lane near the mini-flipper.
- **Anti-Skill Shot**: Plunge the ball into the left outlane. There is an “anti-skill luck shot” if the ball bounces back into play from the post and the player hits the right spinner or the gong!
- **Secret Skill Shot**: Plunge the ball into the inner left inlane.
- **Super Secret Skill Shot**: Plunge the ball into the outer left inlane.
- **Mega Secret Skill Shot**: Plunge to the upper left flipper and make a reflex shot to the cliffs ramp. Scores 1.75M and 8 seconds of ball save time. The skill shot is multiplied by 2x, 3x, or 4x with follow-up shots to the biplane ramp, U-turn, or river, respectively.

On default settings, each skill shot adds more initial ball-save time.

Each *unique* skill shot made during a game instantly adds a letter to **[KING KONG](#heading--trex)**.

If the ball falls back into the shooter lane during single-ball play, a “Sneak-In” award starting at 1M is earned, and the player may attempt another Skill Shot. The “Pisang Raja” **[banana combo](#heading--banana)** requires this to happen off a ricochet from the Pit targets.

Skill shots are also used during the **[deadeye](#heading--deadeye)** side mode.

# <span id="heading--objectives"></span>Main Objectives:

Ann Darrow, Jack Driscoll, and Carl Denham have arrived on the mysterious Terror Island to uncover it’s secrets. Denham, the ambitious filmmaker, aims to capture King Kong, the legendary beast that roams the island, while Jack and Ann are more concerned with uncovering the island’s mystical riches.

There are six main objectives listed above the flippers that must be completed to qualify the wizard mode, **[8th Wonder](#heading--wonder)**. These include the game’s **main modes** (or **[island scenes](#heading--island)**) and various other objectives, some of which can be advanced towards while other objectives are running but others which are mutually exclusive. The objectives and rules for all six are listed below.

## <span id="heading--island"></span>Island Scenes / Gong:

Shoot the gong to light island scenes at the same shot that was used to start them. On the Pro models that lack a gong, island (blue) arrows must be collected to light start scene: one arrow is required to light the first scene increasing by one per scene to a max of five.

Every island scene completed by making the required shots in the 60-second time limit will award a **[map segment](#heading--map)**. The timer can be extended by +15 seconds by hitting the gong, once per scene. Playing all five island scenes rewards island scenes completed level 1 towards **[8th Wonder](#heading--wonder)**, but completing all five island scenes rewards it at level 2. The **[Crash the Gate](#heading--gate)** mini-wizard mode is also made available once all five island scenes are completed, and the player can repeat island scenes as many times as possible until they are completed.

Any **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** can be started during a scene, unless the scene was turned into a 2-ball multiball using **[Island Lock](#heading--lock)**, in which case all progress towards advancing or starting the other multiballs is delayed until the player returns to single-ball play.

There are five Island Scenes:

- **Save Ann**: Shoot lit shots to build the value at the gong shot. Lit shots score 250K + 25K per shot and increase the gong value by 500K + 50K per shot, with combo shots scoring and increasing the value by 2x. The gong value starts at 4M. At least one lit shot must be made to light the gong each time. Shoot the gong shot 3 times to light the final shot at the gong on a hurry-up timer to finish the mode. The final shot’s value starts at the total value of the three lit gong shots that were collected prior. On the Premium / LE, each gong shot will allow the ball to enter the VUK during this mode.

- **Cross the Chasm**: The river entrance (Log Bridge insert, corresponding to the switch above the log diverter) is lit for the entire duration of the mode, hitting it automatically raises the diverter and lights the cliffs ramp for a few seconds. Shoot the cliffs ramp to save the sailors from falling off the bridge. Each explorer saved collects the base value starting at 1.5M and increments it by 500K. Fail to shoot the cliffs ramp in time and a sailor will be lost, resetting the base value to 1.5M. Comboing the U-turn immediately after saving a sailor awards the base value x a multiplier that increases with each lit U-turn shot. Rescue 6 sailors to complete.

- **Pterodactyl Attack**: Hit the lit moving drop target to defeat the pterodactyls for 5M and light the Kong Cave VUK on the far right of the playfield for 2x the award. A clean shot that triggers the rollover above the Kong Cave scoop makes the cave award 3x, and making the Kong Cave without the assistance of the upper flipper adds 3M to the base value. Collect three cave awards to complete, with the second cave award adding a **[KING KONG letter](#heading--trex)**.

- **Stegosaurus Encounter**: Shoot slow flashing shots to take the easy path, or shoot quickly flashing shots to take the hard path. Each shot collects the base value and progress the mode, while each hard path shot also increases a multiplier by +1x for the rest of the mode. The base value starts at 2M and increments by 250K per shot, regardless of path. Shoot 7 shots in total to finish the mode.  
  The shot sequence is as follows:

  <div class="md-table">

  | Shot \# | Easy Path        | Hard Path     |
  |---------|------------------|---------------|
  | 1       | Center spinner   | (none)        |
  | 2       | Center ramp      | Cliffs ramp   |
  | 3       | Gong             | U-turn        |
  | 4       | Left orbit       | Kong Cave VUK |
  | 5       | Biplane ramp     | Left orbit    |
  | 6       | Center ramp      | U-turn        |
  | 7       | Punchback target | (none)        |

  </div>

- **Escape the Swamp**: Build up the value of the punchback jackpot at the right loop by shooting the flashing shots, with combo shots building the value by 2x. After scoring a punchback jackpot, shoot any upper flipper shot to multiply the value (side ramp - 2x, upper loop - 3x, river lane - 4x). Collect three punchback jackpots to complete.

### <span id="heading--lock"></span>Island Locks, Island Jackpots & Victory Challenge

Island Locks are used to upgrade **[island scenes](#heading--island)** modes into 2-ball multiballs. The player cannot advance towards other **[multiball modes](#heading--multiballs)** while in a 2-ball island scene, until the player drains back down to a single ball.

Light island lock at the right orbit by making enough **[climb shots](#heading--climb)** (reaching 200 ft and 500 ft). When lit, the right orbit shot will divert into the hidden sinkhole and the ball will be sent to the right flipper.

These features become enabled if the player activates an island scene mode with island locks:

- **Island Jackpot**: After scoring any *progress* shot in a 2-ball multiball island scene, shoot the cliffs ramp to light island jackpot at the pit. The next time the player shoots the pit, the player will score the island jackpot worth 5M + the total of mode shots up to the point where island jackpot was lit. Knocking the held ball into the pit targets with the other ball, within the 5-second timer, scores an additional 2x island jackpot. The progress shots for each mode are:
  - **Save Ann** - gong hits
  - **Cross the Chasm** - U-turn shots
  - **Pterodactyl Attack** - Kong cave shots
  - **Stegosaurus Encounter** - all lit shots
  - **Escape the Swamp** - punchback target hits
- **Victory Challenge**: After completing the required shots during an island scene, if the player is still in multiball, a victory challenge will start for the rest of the mode’s length (the first 5 lit shots will add +5 seconds to the timer each). All shots are lit to score awards: “easy” shots score 5% of the mode total and “hard” shots score 10% of the mode total. After collecting all of the lit shots, the gong will light to score a victory jackpot worth 50% of the mode total. Victory challenge ends once time runs out or the player drains down to one ball.

### <span id="heading--gate"></span>Crash the Gate:

**Crash the Gate** is the final **[island scene](#heading--island)**, which becomes available once all five other island scenes have been completed. It is qualified in the same way as the previous five island scenes by shooting island arrows (Pro) or hitting the gong repeatedly (Prem / LE).

Crash the Gate is a 90-second timed mode (but can be up to 120 seconds long, as it adds the remaining time from completed island scenes) with a 40-second ball saver. Five shots are lit to start hurry-ups at the gong, with each shot connected to a mode and its total score. +5% of a mode’s total score are added to the hurry-up for each mode played (ie. the first hurry-up starts with 5M + 20% of the first mode total, and the fifth hurry-up starts with 5M + 40% of the fifth mode total). The hurry-up value for each shot is capped at 99M, and the mode timer pauses for each hurry-up.

- **Save Ann** - gong
- **Cross the Chasm** - cliffs ramp
- **Pterodactyl Attack** - drop targets
- **Stegosaurus Encounter** - center spinner
- **Escape the Swamp** - punchback target

Once all 5 hurry-ups are scored, the biplane ramp will light to score the super jackpot, *or* the player can continue to complete sets of 5 hurry-ups to exponentially increase the super jackpot multiplier (2x, 4x, 8x, etc.). The base super jackpot value is worth the total of all hurry-up scores in the mode so far and resets along with its multiplier once it is scored.

Crash the Gate ends once time runs out or the player drains the ball after the initial ball save timer has expired.

## <span id="heading--climb"></span>Climbing the Building:

Shoot the yellow-lit “climb” arrows to ascend the building and collect the awards indicated on the building above the flippers. 4 inserts are initially lit at random; each one awards 25 ft and unlights when the shot is made. Complete the set to climb one section of the building and light another set. After completing 3 sets, the 4th set onwards has 5 lit arrows for 20 ft each, and the 7th set onwards has 6 lit arrows.

Awards are given for every section of the building climbed:

- 100 ft - 5M + **[map segment](#heading--map)**
- 200 ft - Light **[island lock](#heading--lock)** + light **[extra ball](#heading--extraballs)**
- 300 ft - 10M + light **[NYC event 1](#heading--nyc)**
- 400 ft - Spot **[KING KONG letter](#heading--trex)**
- 500 ft - Light **island lock**
- 600 ft - 10M & light **NYC event 2**
- 700 ft - Spot a **[map segment](#heading--map)**
- 800 ft -
- 900 ft
- 1000 ft - 10M & light **NYC event 3**
- 1100 ft -
- 1200 ft -

### <span id="heading--nyc"></span>NYC Events:

Complete all of the climb shots on the current level of a **[building](#heading--climb)** to light the right orbit for NYC Event.

NYC Events *cannot be stacked* with other modes. An NYC Event cannot be started while an **[Island Scene](#heading--island)** or **[multiball](#heading--multiballs)** is active. If **[Rapids](#heading--river)**, **[King Kombos](#heading--kombos)**, and/or **[Biplane Attack](#heading--plane)** are active, they end immediately/prematurely as if they timed out when starting an NYC Event.

**NYC Event Modifiers:** After shooting the right orbit, use the left flipper to choose the modifier for the mode:

- *3-ball multiball (1x scoring)*
  - If less than 3 balls are in-play, advancing a stage will typically add a ball.
  - Draining back down to 1 ball ends the mode.
  - Completing the mode starts victory laps.
- *Limited flip count (2x scoring)*
  - Single-ball, left and right flippers have their own flip counts. Each flipper starts with 30 flips.
  - Ball save is on for the duration of the mode.
  - Hitting the gong will add 10 flips to both flippers, up to 3 times. Advancing a stage will award 3 more flips each on both flippers. Draining the ball will subtract 5 from both flippers.
  - When one flipper is out of flips, it is disabled but the mode can continue. Note that the flipper cannot be held up after the final flip. When both flippers are out of flips, the ball is forcibly drained.
  - Draining with 5 or fewer flips on each flipper ends the mode, but the ball is saved and returns to single-ball play. The auto-plunger does not fire, but skill shots are not available on this plunge.
  - Completing the mode awards bonus points for each flip left.
- *Single-ball, timed (3x scoring)*
  - Starts with a 12-second ball saver.
  - 60-second time limit, each phase completed adds time, but timer cannot exceed 60 seconds.
  - Completing the mode awards bonus points based on time left.

Each modifier can only be chosen once; further NYC Events will force you to choose among those that have not been chosen yet.

- **Stage Fright**: Kong has been captured and needs to escape. Shoot the lit feature to progress, then shoot the punchback target (via right orbit) to break a chain and complete the phase for 2.5M + 250K per phase + 500K per biplane ramp. When the punchback target is lit, features from previous phases are lit red for +1x chain break value. The biplane ramp is always lit to boost values. Completing the fifth right orbit shot ends the mode in success and awards a **map segment**.
  - Phase 1: 2 center ramp shots for 250K then 300K. Biplane ramp adds ???.
  - Phase 2: 80 right spinners for 5K + 250 per spin + ??? per biplane ramp.
  - Phase 3: Complete drop targets for 500K + ??? per biplane ramp.
  - Phase 4: 60 left spinners for 5K + 250 per spin + ??? per biplane ramp.
  - Phase 5: Hit cave 2 times for ??? + ??? per biplane ramp. A clean shot that triggers the rollover above the cave before falling into the cave counts as both shots needed.
- **Window Shopping**: Kong is wrecking buildings trying to search for Ann. Shoot the lit “climb” shots to light red arrows for jackpots - the number of “climb” shots increases for every subsequent jackpot. Shooting the biplane ramp will spot a “climb” shot or add +1x to the jackpot if it is already lit - the jackpot multiplier resets every time one is collected. The mode ends in success and a **map segment** is awarded once six jackpots have been scored.
  - Multiball perk: The first two jackpots will add balls and the third & fourth jackpots will give short ball save timers.
  - Single-ball timed perk: Each jackpot adds +10 seconds to the timer. Completing the drop targets at any time adds +25 seconds to the timer.
- **Manhattan Rampage**: Kong is causing havoc on the streets of Manhattan. Light each major ramp & orbit shot solid by completing them as many times as there are lights in front of them. Complete two shot lanes by lighting up all of their inserts to light a super jackpot (multiball) or light the kong cave (limited flips, single-ball) to complete the mode and award a **map segment**.
  - Multiball perk: Super jackpot is lit at the U-turn upper loop every time a shot is lit completely solid +1x for every shot that was lit prior. The first two super jackpots add a ball. Every super jackpot requires more shot lanes to be completed, to a maximum of 5; and the U-turn will spot shots if super jackpot isn’t lit.
  - Limited flips perk: Completing two lanes will light the kong cave to complete the mode and award a bonus based on the number of shots that were made prior. If all shots were made, they will relight. The U-turn upper loop will always spot shots.
  - Single-ball timed perk: Each shot completed adds +1x to the Retreat finishing bonus. Completing two lanes will light the kong cave to Rampage or Retreat. If the player chooses to Rampage, the mode will keep going and time will be added. If the player chooses to Retreat, they will cash out the finishing bonus and complete the mode.

## <span id="heading--plane"></span>Biplane Attack:

To start Biplane Attack, make enough shots to the side ramp - 3 shots are required to start the first attack.

Biplane Attack is a 30-second timed mode that lights the side ramp for a jackpot that increases as other switches are hit on the playfield: the left spinner and right spinner alternate being lit to increase the value each switch adds to the jackpot. Every time a jackpot is scored, a biplane will be destroyed. The player can defeat multiple biplanes in one round of Biplane Attack.

There are two combos that benefit Biplane Attack and can be scored at any time:

- **Barrel roll**: left orbit - side ramp. Adds +250k to the next biplane destroyed.
- **Chandelle maneuver**: river - punchback target - side ramp. Adds +500k to the next biplane destroyed and +15 seconds to the mode’s timer.

Destroying 5 biplanes is one of the requirements for **[8th Wonder](#heading--wonder)**.

## <span id="heading--trex"></span>Spell KING KONG:

Collect all eight KING KONG letters to light **[T-Rex Battle](#heading--trexbattle)**.

Letters can be collected by…

- Making a **[skill shot](#heading--skillshots)** (one letter earned per unique skill shot)
- Collecting enough switch hits to fill the green bar on the left of the display (lit at the gong)
- Scoring 3, 15, etc. **[cliffs ramp shots](#heading--cliffs)** (lit at the gong)
- Making 2 lit Kong Cave shots during the **pterodactyl attack** **[island scene](#heading--island)** (awarded instantly)
- **[Climbing](#heading--climb)** 700 ft (3 KONG letters, awarded instantly)
- Collecting a flawless **[super sweep](#heading--kombos)** by sweeping all four drop targets before shooting the side ramp (awarded instantly)

Each KING KONG letter awards a different perk that applies to the next shot of a certain type or lights the cliffs ramp for **light island jackpot**.

**Set 1**

- **K**: 5M
- **I**: Boost **[king kombos](#heading--kombos)** +50k
- **N**: Next **[cliffs](#heading--cliffs)** shot awards 2x progress
- **G**: Light **[deadeye](#heading--deadeye)** (Pro); boost **king kombos** +50k (Prem / LE)
- **K**: Next **[river](#heading--river)** shot awards 2x progress
- **O**: Boost **king kombos** + 50k (Pro); light **deadeye** (Prem / LE)
- **N**: Next **[pit](#heading--spider)** shot awards 2x progress + **[map segment](#heading--map)**
- **G**: Light **T-Rex battle**

**Set 2**

- **K**: 5M
- **I**: Boost **king kombos** + 50k
- **N**: Next round of **[biplane attack](#heading--plane)** worth 2x
- **G**: Light **deadeye** (Pro); boost **king kombos** +50k (Prem / LE)
- **K**: Next round of **[king kombos](#heading--kombos)** worth 5x
- **O**: Boost **king kombos** + 50k (Pro); light **deadeye** (Prem / LE)
- **N**: Super cave target (cave target scores 10M + 2.5M per shot for the next 30 seconds)
- **G**: Light **T-Rex battle**

### <span id="heading--deadeye"></span>Deadeye:

Deadeye mode is lit at the Kong cave eject after making it halfway through spelling **[KING KONG](#heading--trex)** (ie. collecting the first “G”) on the Pro, or collecting the “O” in KING KONG on the Prem / LE. It can only be started during single-ball play.

This mode plays similarly to the Skill Fire mode on Williams’ *Congo*, but with an added jackpot feature. The ball will be held at the Kong cave eject and the player will have unlimited ball save for 30 seconds to make as many **[skill shots](#heading--skillshots)** as possible by plunging the ball with the correct strength. After scoring three Deadeye awards, the river lane will be lit to score the Deadeye jackpot for 3M + the total value of non-jackpot awards collected before plunging into the river lane. This process resets until time runs out, with a short grace period on the last skill shot before the mode ends.

The deadeye award starts at 1M and increases by 500k for each award collected. Certain skill shots multiply the value: the pit standups for 1x; left outlane is 2x; left inlane is 3x; outer-left inlane is 5x.

Scoring the Deadeye jackpot awards a **[map segment](#heading--map)**.

### <span id="heading--trexbattle"></span>T-Rex Battle:

Once **[KING KONG](#heading--trex)** has been spelled, the next shot to the gong during single-ball, non-mode play will start T-Rex Battle.

Shoot all of the flashing arrows to score awards while avoiding slingshots. Shoot the biplane ramp to spot random shots. Light *Pummel* at the Spider Pit after three shots of the *same color* are hit (green on the left, and blue on the right).

If 15 slingshots are triggered, the player must hit the gong to save Ann; all progress towards T-Rex damage is postponed until the gong is hit.

Once all of the currently flashing arrows of the same color have been hit, shoot the pit to hold the ball and light the action button to rapidly pummel the T-Rex for 100k + 2k per button mash for 10 seconds. Each red arrow shot during pummel adds 500k to the pummel value, increases the pummel multiplier by +1x (applied to the total of all button presses when the timer expires), and increases the Pummel phase timer.

Defeating one T-Rex awards an add a ball. Defeating both T-Rex will complete the mode, start victory laps, and give credit for the “T-Rex Defeated” light towards **[8th Wonder](#heading--wonder)**.

## <span id="heading--multiballs"></span>Multiballs:

Scoring a super jackpot during King Kong Multiball and starting all three Pit Multiballs are required to fill their respective lights on the playfield gate.

### <span id="heading--kong"></span>King Kong Multiball:

Light the locks for this multiball at the center ramp by completing the drop targets when “light kong lock” is flashing. All three locks will be lit the first time, but afterwards only one lock will light at a time. The third lock will start King Kong Multiball (or light it to start at the right orbit on the Pro).

King Kong multiball starts on the Prem / LE by releasing all three balls from the train for Kong awards at the side ramp. The Kong award then resets to a lower value for the rest of the multiball.

Though all green shots during King Kong multiball score smaller awards with a Kong award for 5x at the side ramp, the jackpots (red arrows) must be lit. For the first jackpot round of a game, hitting any drop target will light the center spinner and punchback target for 1x jackpot and the cliffs ramp for 2x jackpot. After this first jackpot round, all drop targets must be completed to light jackpots and the center spinner won’t award jackpots.

After scoring either jackpot, shoot the side ramp to score a super jackpot (combo for 2x super jackpot). The jackpot increases as green arrow shots are made and is multiplied as side ramps are made prior to collecting the super jackpot.

A ball can be relocked in the train by collecting all of the green arrow awards, then shooting the center ramp. The relock multiplies all jackpots by 2x and lasts 20 seconds before releasing the ball. On the Pro, the ball is not physically held during the timed 2x jackpots.

**[Island mystery](#heading--mystery)** is disabled during this multiball, so add-a-balls can’t be earned from it. Instead, balls can be added once per multiball by ringing the gong twice.

### <span id="heading--spider"></span>Spider Pit Multiballs:

Hit the targets around the pit to battle the pit creatures and start multiball. Rolling through the right inlane briefly lights the pit to score 2x progress to the next multiball.

The first multiball requires four pit shots, three to light it and one to start it. Two more pit shots are required to start subsequent multiballs. There are three pit multiballs and when you only have one shot left to start a Pit Multiball, the lit one changes every 10 seconds.

The three multiballs are, from top to bottom:

- **2-Legged Lizard**: Shoot the pit three times to light jackpot and score increasing points. To score the jackpot, shoot the pit, then knock the ball held by the magnet into the targets. Lit shots increase the jackpot by 500k. The maximum jackpot value is ?
- **Octopus Insect**: Shoot all three right-side standup targets to light the jackpot at the pit. Far left standup target increases target values, and red shots increase jackpot value. Finish multiple rounds of standup targets to increase the jackpot multiplier.
- **Giant Spider**: Collect 30 switch hits (+5 per jackpot) to light jackpot at the pit. Further non-spinner switch hits increase the base jackpot value. Shoot the ramps to increase the jackpot multiplier +1x. Each lit ramp can only be hit once meaning the maximum jackpot multiplier is 4x, and the maximum jackpot value is 25M x 4.

**[Island Mystery](#heading--mystery)** (lit via **[River Awards](#heading--river)**) will always award Add-A-Ball the first time it is collected during any of the first three pit multiballs.

After playing all three pit multiballs, the fourth pit multiball will be **Spider Queen** 3-ball multiball. The spider queen’s spawn must be defeated by hitting randomly lit major shots and then scoring the super jackpot at the pit to deal damage to the queen. The super jackpot starts at 5M + 50% of the total from the 3 previous pit multiballs. Every super jackpot scored means more jackpots to make before the next one is lit: 4 for the first 2 super jackpots, 5 for the 3rd, 6 for the 4th, and 7 for all subsequent supers.

The mystery add-a-ball is disabled during Spider Queen multiball. Instead, if the player is below 4 balls during the multiball, hitting the island treasure standup behind the drop targets will add a ball; up to 2 balls can be added this way.

Play Spider Queen multiball to complete level 1 towards **[8th Wonder](#heading--wonder)**, and score at least 250M during Spider Queen to complete level 2 towards it.

# <span id="heading--other"></span>Other Scoring:

## <span id="heading--map"></span>Map Segments & Treasure Hunt:

Complete game objectives to earn **map segments** towards completing the current map. There are two segments for the first map, and each map gains one more segment than the last. Each segment awards 5M with a 10M bonus for completing the current map. The objectives that award map segments are:

- Completing any **[island scene](#heading--island)**
- **Island scenes** level 2 (completed all 5 island scenes)
- **[Climb](#heading--climb)** 100ft
- Complete any **[NYC event](#heading--nyc)**
- **Climb** level 2 (2 buildings fully climbed)

- 20 **[cliffs](#heading--cliffs)** ramp shots
- Collecting 8 **[banana combos](#heading--banana)**
- Rare **[mystery award](#heading--mystery)** (once per game)

Once the map is completed, the Kong cave will light to start a **treasure hunt**. Make six randomly lit gold shots to follow the directions on the map - the final shot will always be at the kong cave - and collect a perk that changes with every treasure hunt complete.

Making the final shot of a treasure hunt awards the treasure hunt jackpot, which starts at 20M and increases as switches are hit during the hunt. The treasure hunt jackpot is multiplied by +1x for every treasure that has been found during the game, whether from treasure hunt or from the **[Lost Temple glyphs](#heading--treasure)**.

If the ball drains during a treasure hunt, then the treasure will be lost. Treasure hunts can run at any time during the game, even during other modes, but can only start during single-ball play.

The perks for completing each treasure hunt are:

- **Map 1** (Crown of the Forgotten God) - Add +15 seconds to all super mode timers. This applies to the three super modes from **[island treasures](#heading--treasure)** 1, 2 and 4, and to the **super cave target** mode described in the section about **[KING KONG letters](#heading--trex)**.
- **Map 2** - Double **[end-of-ball bonus](#heading--bonus)** for the rest of the game.
- **Map 3** (Echo Horn) - The player now starts every ball with maximum **[log bridge](#heading--bridge)** uses.
- **Map 4** (Jade Goat of Sternness) - Easier to start **[2x scoring](#heading--2x)**. All targets will now be lit to start it or increase its timer, instead of only one being lit at a time.
- **Map 5** (Golden Gary) - Award 500M points. This massive award cannot be multiplied by 2x scoring.

## <span id="heading--river"></span>River Awards / Rapids:

Light the River by completing the drop targets or hitting the U-turn lane from the upper right flipper during single-ball play. Going through the lit River lane on the left side of the playfield counts up and grants various awards over time.

- 3, 9, 12, 20, 30… : **[Light Island Mystery](#heading--mystery)**
- 5, 15, 25… : **Rapids**
- 8: **[Light Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)**

Once Rapids begins, you have 30 seconds to loop the center spinner shot to build the collect value, displayed on the screen. Shoot the Kong Cave to cash out and end the Rapids feature, and collect a **[map segment](#heading--map)**.

## <span id="heading--bridge"></span>Log Bridge (Action Button):

The log bridge is a hidden diverter near the **[river](#heading--river)** shot that diverts all balls to the mini-flipper, allowing the player to pick off drop targets or hit the **[cliffs ramp](#heading--cliffs)**. While the diverter often activates on its own during modes that require cliffs ramp shots, the player can also control when this bridge activates.

The player starts each ball with 2 log bridge uses, and more can be earned by completing the **[drop targets](#heading--treasure)** during the ball to award 1 log bridge use to a maximum of 5. To use the log bridge, press the action button right before the ball enters the river lane, either after shooting the right orbit or even off of the initial plunge.

## <span id="heading--cliffs"></span>Cliff Awards:

Shooting some number of “The Cliffs” shots from the upper playfield grants awards over the span of the game.

- 3, 15… : **[KING KONG letter](#heading--trex)** (or 15M if KING KONG is already spelled)
- 6: Light **[cliffhanger](#heading--cliffhanger)**
- 20: Light **cliffhanger** + award **[map segment](#heading--map)**
- 25: **[Light Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)**

## <span id="heading--cliffhanger"></span>Cliffhanger (Left Outlane Ball Save):

Light Cliffhanger at the left outlane by scoring 6, then 20, **[cliffs ramp shots](#heading--cliffs)**. Cliffhanger can only be used in single-ball play and only if a wizard mode isn’t running.

The player now has 12 seconds to hit the power-up target near the drop targets to save their ball and resume play. If the player fails to shoot it in time, the ball will automatically end. The number of power-up target hits required increases by 1 for each successful cliffhanger.

Settings can allow cliffhanger to score 50M and end the ball if lit, or act as a virtual kickback. The default behavior is described above.

## <span id="heading--2x"></span>2x Scoring:

The orange targets around the playfield are all marked with an “X”. Once all four have been hit (twice for subsequent attempts), hitting the roving orange target that moves from left to right and back will start 2x scoring. The timer can be extended by continuing to shoot the lit orange targets, and each lit orange target scores bonus points when they are hit while 2x scoring is running. The 2x scoring timer can be extended four times every time it is started.

Completing the fourth **[treasure hunt](#heading--map)** of a game makes 2x scoring much easier to start. All targets will count as progression towards starting it, and any target hit will start it when it has been qualified; and during 2x scoring, every target shot will extend the timer, not just the lit one.

## <span id="heading--treasure"></span>Lost Temple & Island Treasure:

Light Lost Temple at the right orbit by hitting the punchback target or Kong Cave twice while at least one unlit drop target is available. Once lit, if the player is in single-ball play, the next right orbit shot will always send the ball to the mini-flipper and light a drop target that hasn’t been lit yet. Hitting the drop target will award one light’s worth of progress towards completing the glyph puzzle, *and* complete the next drop targets’ worth of progress towards either **[King Kombos](#heading--kombos)** or **[light kong lock](#heading--kong)** instantly.

Once the puzzle is completed by hitting three flashing drop targets after lighting Lost Temple, shoot the island treasure target behind the upper two drop targets to collect the current Island Treasure. Subsequent treasures require all four drop target lights to be lit instead of just three, and every Island Treasure scored will add a +1x multiplier to the next **[treasure hunt jackpot](#heading--map)**.

- Drillplate of Dunne: 10M + light **Super Spinners** (starts on the next spinner rip: alternate between left and right spinners for 100k per spin + 50k per lit spinner rip for 30 seconds. Spinner rips cap out at 25M, at which point the opposite spinner must be hit.)
- Lost Skull of the Ancients: 10M + light **Super Kombos** (starts on the next shot made: starts **[King Kombos](#heading--kombos)** for 30 seconds but at 3x value per shot)
- Heart of the Keepers: 10M + Extra Ball
- Moonstone of N’zai: 10M + light **Super Rapids** (starts on the next river shot: for the next 30 seconds, all shots increase a multiplier for points scored at the river lane)
- Obsidian Dagger: 100M
- Serpent’s Eye: 100M

## <span id="heading--million"></span>2.42 Million Bananas:

There is a hidden lane under the Kong figure, to the left of the punchback target. This hidden lane is more visible on the Pro and can only be hit with particularly weak shots to either the left orbit or punchback target lane.

Whenever a ball falls into this lane, 2.42 million points are scored and the best possible shot will be spotted if a mode is currently active. This hidden lane also spots a **[climb arrow](#heading--climb)** if they are available.

(Fun fact: 2.42 million bananas refers to the “1 million bananas” insert from Data East’s *King Kong*, just updated for today’s inflation.)

## <span id="heading--kombos"></span>King Kombos:

After clearing the drops when the King Kombos insert is lit, King Kombos starts. The kombo value builds as you continue to shoot kombos, and every 3 kombos lights **[power-up](#heading--powerup)**. Even-numbered **[KING KONG letters](#heading--trex)** each add 50k to the kombo value.

There are two combos that can be earned even if King Kombos isn’t running.

- **Super Sweep**: A bonus is awarded if the player hits at least 2 drop targets in the same shot that passes through the left orbit, then shoots the side ramp to complete the combo for 10M. If all 4 drop targets are swept in the same shot, the side ramp will award 50M and spot a **[KING KONG letter](#heading--trex)**!
- **Ricochet**: Shooting the rubber near the mini-flipper (from the right flipper) and bouncing up the cliffs ramp scores 5M. The combo is disqualified if the left flipper is pressed and can only be earned in single-ball play.

## <span id="heading--banana"></span>Banana Combos:

There are many different combos corresponding to different banana types that can be scored during single-ball play. Collecting 7 awards a **[map segment](#heading--map)**.

## <span id="heading--bonus"></span>End-of-Ball Bonus:

Height climbed and KING KONG letters collected are cumulative across balls, while switch hits and bonus X resets with each ball.

Collecting the second treasure from **[treasure hunt](#heading--map)** doubles the entirety of end-of-ball bonus for the rest of the game.
