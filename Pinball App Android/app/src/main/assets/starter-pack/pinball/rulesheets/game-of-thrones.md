**Choose Your House**

At the beginning of a game, you will be able to choose which one out of the seven houses to fight for. After choosing a house, that house’s mode is immediately qualified to play (except Targaryen, which immediately spots the mode as completed), and more importantly, you acquire the house’s in-game powers, both persistent benefits as well as player-controlled one-time benefits initiated through the Action Button. Every house’s Action abilities are available only once per ball, except Lannister as well as Greyjoy (in some instances). When the Action Button is solidly lit in the color of your house (or Plundered house), it is available and ready to use.

As of recent code, you may now also replace your chosen House’s Action Button power (not Persistent ability) by purchasing one of three House Action abilities in the Mystery selection screen: if you collect a lot of gold, Martell, Baratheon, and Tyrell house abilities may be purchased. (Example: Martell costs 3,800 gold) The purchased House Action ability *replaces* your current House Action ability for the *remainder of the game.*

These powers are:

- **Stark:**  
  **Persistent:** Adds 10 million to the base value of all Winter is Coming Hurry-Ups. This can make Winter Has Come particularly valuable if the player is skilled enough, along with increasing the potential scoring of the Hurry-Ups through combos, but otherwise doesn’t have many practical uses.  
  **Action Button -** *Direwolf* … Ghost to the rescue: activating it will immediately complete the house mode you are playing. If you’ve stacked two modes, it will only complete one of the two modes: the house that is listed on top during mode selection screen will be the one that gets completed by Direwolf. The “top” house will correspond with the house displayed on the left of DMD during the stacked modes. Direwolf only awards 5 million points in lieu of any points that would be scored in the mode, so it’s best used as a way to ensure you reach HOTK or Iron Throne sooner.

- **Baratheon:**  
  **Persistent:** Awards 2 advances towards Battle for the Wall Multiball immediately at the start of the game, and increases Jackpot values during Wall MB. Each completion of drops (presumably during single-ball play only) also advances toward Wall MB.  
  **Action Button:** *Lord of Light*… You’ve got the Red Woman on speed dial: get an instant timed outlane ball-save on both outlanes. Timer looks like it lasts only a few seconds after hitting your next switch.

- **Lannister:**  
  **Persistent:** Shooting gold targets will award around 1.5x the gold you’d obtain otherwise with other houses. 500 gold is also given at the start of the game. Some of the Mystery awards at high amounts of gold can be worth decent amounts, particularly when stacked with mixed multipliers, and you’ll be hitting the gold targets by accident throughout gameplay anyway. More importantly, as Lannister, you can now spend your gold on playfield multipliers.  
  **Action Button:** *Golden Playfield X*… It pays to be rich: you can instantaneously buy your next PFx level without hitting the battering ram. The PFx level cost = N PFx times 600 gold. So 2x PFx costs 1,200 gold, 3x PFx costs 1,800 gold, etc. You cannot purchase a PFx level that you have not yet qualified from Sword collects.  
  Note: The Golden PFx ability is *not* limited to once per ball. However, there is overall cap of 8 uses *throughout your game*, so use this wisely!

- **Greyjoy:**  
  **Persistent:** Gain the persistent powers of other Houses when you complete their House mode. These powers stack as you complete more Houses. As a drawback, each House battle adds more shots required and you may only battle one House at a time. Additionally, the game begins with House Greyjoy completed.  
  **Action Button:** *Plunder*… Pay the Iron Price: Greyjoy has no initial Action Button ability, but the *most recent* house that you defeated becomes your Action ability. A newly Plundered Action ability may be used during the same ball as a prior Plundered Action you already activated.

- **Tyrell:**  
  **Persistent:** One inlane is always lit to increase the combo multiplier. Lit inlane toggles via lane-change. Tyrell’s power may seem small, but it means a LOT - especially during modes.  
  **Action Button:** *Iron Bank* … Trading multipliers for points with the Braavosi bank: same concept as the original code Iron Bank, but with increasing exponential points based on the combination of PFx and ComboX levels that are running when you cash it in. Can be worth up to approx 300M max point value, apparently. As before, cashing in Iron Bank eliminates your active PFx and ComboX.  
  Note: all other non-Tyrell houses that used to have Iron Bank no longer have Iron Bank ability.

- **Martell:**  
  **Persistent:** None.  
  **Action Button:** *Add-A-Ball* … During any Multiball, press the action button to obtain an add-a-ball.

- **Targaryen** (you can now play as Targaryen!)  
  **Persistent:** Similar to Greyjoy, the Targaryen mode is immediately spotted as complete – house completion without playing any of the three levels of Targaryen.  
  **Action Button:** *Freeze Timers*… Even timers bend the knee to Khaleesi: immediately pause all actively running timers (not including ball-save timers) for 15 seconds. Any timers that start during the Freeze period will start out as paused, and then begin their count-down only after Freeze has expired.

Summary of new additional persistent house benefits from post-1.34 code (not action button-related):  
Lannister: when you hit the standups, they give 143% more gold than previous code.  
Baratheon: completing the drop target bank advances progress toward Wall MB.  
Targaryen: (you can now choose to play as Targaryen!) it immediately and completely spots Targaryen house completion without playing any of the three levels of Targaryen.

**Shots**

There are 7 major shots on the game:

Left Drop Target 3-Bank: A bank of drop targets that, when completed, lights Lord of Light once per game (see below) and advances the spinner by one level. Qualifies House Baratheon at the left ramp after three completions.

Left Loop: A loop half with a spinner. Can be backhanded from the left flipper. Qualifies House Greyjoy at the left ramp after three completions. On the Premium / LE models, an issue with the gates near the bumpers will often result in obtaining two shots to the left loop.

\[Pro\] Dragon: A lane that has a kicker target at the end and a post to trap the ball if needed. Used as the Mystery and Extra Ball shots, and to start Battle at the Wall Multiball. Qualifies House Targaryen at the left ramp after three completions.  
-or-  
\[Premium/LE\] Castle Black: A lane (longer than the Dragon shot) that has a kicker target at the end. Used to advance towards Battle at the Wall Multiball. Qualifies House Targaryen at the left ramp after three completions.

Left Ramp: A ramp that arcs around the right half of the playfield and feeds the right flipper. Can be shot from both flippers from a cradle, but usually is shot from the right flipper (backhands tend to occur more often on the Premium / LE model, however). Locks balls for Blackwater Multiball, starts Hand of the King & Iron Throne wizard modes, and starts House Battles. Qualifies House Lannister after three completions… meaning that if you’ve selected a house that isn’t Lannister, starting Blackwater Multiball without having made the left ramp prior will always allow you to choose a House Battle to stack up with the Multiball.

Right Ramp: A ramp that arcs around the playfield and feeds the left flipper on the Pro or the upper playfield on the Premium/LE. Can be backhanded from the right flipper. House Stark’s shot.

Right Loop: The second half of the loop, which feeds the Iron Throne toy on the Premium/LE for the Extra Ball, Mystery, and Battle at the Wall Multiball start. Otherwise, this shot doesn’t have anything special attached to it. House Martell’s shot.

Right Target 2-Bank: A bank of touch targets that light locks for Blackwater Multiball and light Wildfire when completed. House Tyrell’s shot.

**Miscellaneous Things**

All versions allow for a soft plunge and a hard plunge. Playfield validation occurs on a rollover hit.

\[Pro\]  
Skill Shot: Hard plunge into the lit lane to collect the skill shot award of (500k x Ball \#) and 1 bonus X.

\[Premium/LE\]  
Plunge options: There is no skill shot, but a hard plunge will feed the upper playfield once per ball.

Bonus X: Complete the two top lanes to increase the bonus multiplier. Bonus X can also be awarded in the pop bumpers or as a Mystery Award. \[Pro\] Top lane completions also advance to the Wall Multiball. Bonus X caps out at 20x.

Bumper awards: Shooting a ball into the pop bumpers allows several awards to be matched up on the display. These can be collected at any time. Some awards I’ve seen are:

- Increase Winter is Coming (spots a shot)
- Increase Bonus Multiplier (1x or 3x)
- More Time (10 seconds during a mode, or a portion of any hurry-up)
- Big Points (1 million)
- Advance Wall (advances towards the multiball)
- Collect 5 Wildfire
- Collect Gold (750 if playing as Lannister, 150 otherwise)
- Light Wildfire Mini-Mode
- Light Extra Ball (at the Dragon \[Pro\]/Right Loop \[Premium/LE\])
- Light Sword
- Collect Special
- Add-A-Ball (see below)

As a side note, this style of pop bumper usage has been trademarked by Stern under ReelPops, so there could be more of this style of pop bumper in future (or current, such as Wrestlemania) Stern games.

Mystery: Completing all of the gold standup targets lights the Mystery shot at the \[Pro\] Dragon or \[Premium/LE\] Right Loop; shoot it to initiate the award select. You will be presented with three options: keep your gold, and two awards that cost gold. One award is a generally random award that costs some of your gold, and the other award is the most expensive you can buy. Mystery awards include:

- Big Points (1M, multiplied by playfield/combo multipliers)
- Bigger Points (5M, multiplied by playfield/combo multipliers)
- Biggest Points (25M, multiplied by playfield/combo multipliers)
- Video Mode (1x, 2x, 3x scoring)
- Light House (that has not been qualified)
- Increase Bonus Multipliers (1x or 3x)
- Light Lock
- 5 Wildfire
- Light Extra Ball
- Light 1x/2x/3x Super Jackpot
- Light Playfield Multiplier
- Collect Golden Hand (750k end-of-ball Bonus)
- Light Lord of Light (on Outlanes)
- Hold Bonus
- Award 1/2 Castle Multiball advance(s) \[Premium/LE\]

*All “Big” point awards are displayed as their multiplied values.*

Specials: 25 million

Winter is Coming: Once a house is lit, the shot you made to advance to it “ices over”. Complete any combination of three “iced over” shots or target banks (does not necessarily have to be the same shot) to start the mode. During the mode, the last “iced over” shot will flash and no other progress (other than locks, lighting outlanes, and multiball starts) can be made. Shoot the flashing white shot to collect the hurry up value. Collect four hurry-up values to begin the Winter Has Come mini-wizard mode. Each of the seven shots can be collected (both target banks, both ramps, both loops, and the dragon). *Warning: if your third Blackwater lock is lit and you start Winter is Coming on the center ramp, multiball will start without the option to choose House modes to stack into it! One possible workaround strategy is to just get the center ramp hurryup out of the way before locking balls. This is by design and is not a bug.*

Multipliers: There are two types of multipliers in the game: one for the overall playfield scoring and another for combos collected. Making shots allows the multipliers for other shots to increase up to 5x. Shooting the battering ram 3 times qualifies the playfield multiplier, and shooting it again begins a round where all playfield values are 2x for a period of time. For each subsequent 4 hits to the ram, the playfield multiplier will increase 1x to a maximum of 5x. The higher the multipliers are, the less time you have to use them. These multipliers can be cashed in at any time during the ball by pressing the action button; despite taking away all multipliers, this also can award some decent points. The best way to handle cashing in is by pressing the action button as the ball drains. **Exception:** If you have wildfire lit at the ram, only 3 hits are required to increase the playfield multiplier. Also, you will notice that after the first hit to the battering ram the blue arrow in front of it will start flashing. While this is flashing, you can advance to the next portion of lighting the playfield multiplier. If this times out, you must hit the ram again, get the arrow flashing, then hit the ram a second time to advance. So, while in theory it only takes 3-4 hits to the ram to increase the playfield multiplier, if you take too much time, it can take you more hits.

Lord of Light targets: Completing the three drop targets to the left activate ball saves at the left + right outlanes. By default, the targets will only award ONE Lord of Light per **game**, so use it wisely! Further Lord of Lights can only be obtained through the pop bumper or shop mystery features.

Wildfire: To light the Wildfire mini-mode, complete a set of lock targets or earn the mode through Mystery/Pop Bumper awards. Shooting the battering ram allows you to collect Wildfire when lit by shooting it again and again. The first hit gives 10 Wildfire, and each subsequent hit gives 1 more Wildfire than the previous hit. Wildfire increases your Blackwater Multiball jackpots, though it has a diminishing effect the more Wildfire you have. You can also collect 5 Wildfire from a pop bumper award or by locking balls for Blackwater Multiball.

Swords: Completing any house mode (or a pop bumper award) lights the right ramp to collect an sword. These can be multiplied for huge points. They also allow you to advance your playfield multipliers higher – initially, you can only go up to 3x, but each sword increases the cap by 1x up to 5x. Further Swords are just for point awards.

**Multiballs**

**Blackwater Multiball**: Shoot the two standup targets to the right to light lock at the left ramp. You must lock a ball prior to lighting your next lock. Lock 3 balls to begin the multiball. During multiball, complete the five major shots to collect Jackpots and light the Super Jackpot at the battering ram. The Super Jackpot stays lit for 20 seconds and can be collected as many times as you hit the ram, which also counts for playfield multiplier increases. The Super Jackpot is worth ((6 \* SJP level \* jackpot amount) + SJP BASE AMOUNT) \* playfield multiplier. When the Super Jackpot times out with the multiball still running, the Jackpots re-light and need to be collected twice, but the second shot and the Super Jackpot are worth double. Timing out subsequent Super Jackpots will add another shot required for completion at 1x higher multiplier, and make the Super worth 1x more. Locks for the first multiball only require one hit to either green target; 2nd BWMB locks require both individual targets to be hit; 3rd+ BWMB requires completing both targets on a timer after the first target is hit.

**Wall Multiball**:  
\[Pro\] Completing the top lanes 6 times enables Wall Multiball. Shoot the dragon to begin the multiball.  
\[Premium/LE\] Shooting Castle Black 6 times enables Wall Multiball. Shoot the right loop to begin the multiball.  
\[Both\] Completing the Baratheon drop targets, while playing *as* House Baratheon, also spots one advancement toward Wall.  
Once the 3-ball multiball begins, shoot 3 ramp shots to collect Jackpots and light the Super Jackpot on the Dragon. The Jackpots will then be lit on the loops. Shooting 3 loops lights the Dragon again for a Super Jackpot, and Jackpots return to the ramps. Baratheon’s powerup increases the value of the Jackpot and Super Jackpot, and used to be a viable house for high scores via Wall MB, but later code revisions decreased the points from Wall MB significantly. Further Wall multiballs require 11 top lane completions/Castle Black shots.

Add-A-Ball: An Add-A-Ball is available for all multiball modes. Add-A-Ball is added to the pop bumper awards, and can be cycled into randomly (there is no way to favor it as an award). This can only work once per multiball. This is separate from House Martell’s Add-A-Ball, and whether that has been used or not has no apparent influence on the bumper Add-A-Ball.

You may not stack these two multiballs, nor make progress toward either one during another multiball.

**House Modes**

At the beginning of a game, the house you have selected will always be the first mode available. However, shooting other shots three times each during the game enough times enables other modes to be activated. If you have two or more modes qualified, you may choose to play two house modes at once (stacked) so long as you are not playing as House Greyjoy. The modes are activated by shooting the left ramp at any time when the mode start light is lit, and a player may strategically choose to pass and choose to battle no houses. If you choose to Pass, then you must qualify a new house mode or light the third Blackwater Multiball lock in order to relight the mode start shot on the left ramp. You cannot “pass” on a mode if you only have one mode left to complete. All modes are timed (except for Targaryen III, which lasts until completed or you drain). Failure to complete timed modes will force the player to restart the mode by shooting the left ramp (re-qualifying a failed mode is not required). Progress through modes is saved only for certain houses. These modes are:

- **Stark**: Loop the left or right ramp to advance the kill list and increase the payoff score, then shoot the left or right orbit after 3 (1 if the mode is reset) ramps to collect the payoff score and finish the mode. 40 second timer. Greyjoy players require both loops and ramps to be shot (for jackpot advances) as well before the mode will end. Must be restarted if failed.

- **Baratheon**: You build the value of this mode and then collect by shooting the one of the three targets on the three bank on the left side of the play field. The mode starts with the left orbit shield flashing yellow. Hitting the spinner (from either orbit) lights the dragon shot yellow as well. You must hit at least the dragon shot in order to cash in on the value you’ve built, which you will know is qualified when the shield is flashing in front of the three bank. 40 second timer. Greyjoy players must also hit the center ramp. Oddly, the ramp also lights up for non-Greyjoy games as well; hitting it doesn’t seem to do anything. Must be restarted if failed.

- **Lannister**: Shoot gold targets to light the two adjacent shots and increase shot value. Make five lit shots to end the mode. This mode is timed at 40 seconds. Greyjoy players must hit every shot once (for shot value increases) as well. Progress is saved if failed. Recommended to stack with a multiball.

- **Greyjoy**: All of the main shots are lit. Complete them to finish the mode. 15 second timer, with the timer refreshing on a completed shot. This house is already completed for you if you select Greyjoy to begin with. Progress is saved if failed.

- **Tyrell**: Lit shots alternate between ramps/dragon and lock targets. For the first cycle, the Dragon and the Ramps will be lit. Shooting a lit shot lights the lock target bank, and shooting the target bank lights the two ramps (no Dragon). After the second cycle, only the right ramp will be lit. Greyjoy players need to hit each ramp shot and the Dragon once (for mode scores) to complete. Progress is saved if failed.

- **Martell**: Shoot the left or right orbit three times within 10 seconds (refreshing after the second orbit shot) for increasing mode hurry-up value, then shoot either ramp to finish off the mode and collect the hurry-up. Mode timer is 30 seconds, refreshing if under 10 seconds when a lit shot is made. Greyjoy players will have ramps lit for jackpot advances, but do not necessarily have to be hit. The final ramp shot does not necessarily need to be made; it is purely for bonus points. Making the three orbit combo is enough to finish the mode. Must be restarted if failed.

- **Targaryen**: There are three dragon modes which increase in difficulty. There will be a set number of shots lit. Complete these, then shoot the dragon to complete the first wave. Repeat for waves 2 and 3. The mode will end after defeating each dragon, requiring you to shoot the mode start to begin battle with the next dragon. Defeat all three dragons to finish the mode. All three dragons save progress if failed. The entire mode (all three dragons) is immediately spotted for you if you play as House Targaryen.

Dragons 1 and 2 will light the ramps, loops, and then dragon for hurry-ups. Level 1 requires one of each ramp/loop to be shot to progress to the next shot, Level 2 requires both. Level 3 lights 3 shots for hurry-ups; collect all 3 to light the Dragon. In addition, any shots on the Dragon will spot a lit hurry-up. The three shots per wave appear to be random each time. Complete this cycle 4 times to complete Targaryen. If you take too long to complete a wave during Level 3, you are “attacked” (“DRAGON FIRE!”) and you must restart that wave with a different set of “penalty” shots – however, you do not time out of the mode entirely. Greyjoy players have a hurry-up at the target banks (only one needs to be hit) before starting a Level.

Completing three House Modes lights Extra Ball. Completing four modes qualifies Hand of the King wizard mode. Completing all modes qualifies Iron Throne wizard mode.

**Winter Has Come Mini Wizard Mode:**

Completing four Winter Is Coming hurry-ups will immediately begin Winter Has Come. WHC is a four-ball multiball with two alternating phases:

- **Horde**: A timer is activated, and all seven major shots are lit. Each shot made awards points and restarts the timer. If the timer runs out at any point, another shot will be added. The timer is not shown on the DMD; you must listen carefully for a clock ticking. Completing all seven lit shots begins the Lieutenant Phase.
- **Lieutenant**: Three shots are lit as hurry-ups on their own timers. Once one shot is hit, a new shot will start timing out. If a shot times out, the left flipper will become frozen and be temporarily deactivated until the center ramp is hit with the right flipper. If all three shots time out, you’ll have to shoot a lit shot in a small period to get back to this mode; if that timer runs out, you’ll have to face the Horde again. Collecting five shots during this mode awards the Winter is Coming Super Jackpot, which instantly awards all the hurry-up values you collected from Winter is Coming again. This will also send you back to Horde, for shots at more Super Jackpots.

The values of the four WIC hurryups collected will influence the jackpot scoring in this mode, meaning Stark’s ability can make this mode quite lucrative. Once WHC is complete, no more WIC hurryups can be collected until Iron Throne is completed; all shots corresponding to lit houses will no longer “ice-over”.

It is possible to stack Winter Has Come with Wall or Blackwater multiball. To achieve this, you must start your fourth Winter Is Coming hurryup on a shot that will **not** start the multiball you need. While the hurryup is counting down, start your desired multiball. The hurryup will continue into your multiball. Collect it before it expires, and Winter Has Come will stack into your existing multiball!

**Hand of the King Mini Wizard Mode:**

Completing four houses while not currently challenging a house will light HOTK.  
The houses that you take into HOTK wizard mode can be important. Each house brings with it an attribute that will make it easier or more difficult to get through the mode. They are as follows:

- **Stark**: Bonus round - 20 Seconds of free shooting after a completed set (lights up random shots for points; you may not want to go for these, it’s a waste of time and it could end HOTK prematurely)
- **Baratheon**: All 7 shots instead of 4 shots must be completed in order to finish a set.
- **Lannister**: +100,000,000 added to hurry-up
- **Greyjoy**: One less set needed to start super jackpot hurry up
- **Tyrell**: +15,000,000 per super jackpot
- **Martell**: All shots must be completed twice
- **Targaryen**: +500,000 per shot award

*Bear in mind that even though Stark, Baratheon and Martell sound undesriable to bring in, they do offer more opportunities for shots that can mitigate what would be an otherwise poor HOTK.*

**HOTK** is a mini wizard mode that is completed in “sets”.

- Each set starts with four shots to complete (or 7 if Baratheon is brought in).
- The shots needed to complete the set are dictated by the houses you have carried into HOTK with you.
- The value collected from shots also adds to the Super Jackpot value
- After completing all the shots that are lit, the super jackpot will be lit at the battering ram. The Super is determined through the best four shots made in the set. Collecting the super will complete the set.
- Completing 3 sets (2 if Greyjoy is brought in) will start an even larger hurry up at the battering ram. Once this is collected or times out, everything starts over.

You’ll also notice that the inlanes will be flashing yellow. A ball that travels through the inlane will increase the combo value of each of the main shots to the by 1x, and set all shots to the maximum current shot multiplier. For instance, if your multipliers are \[1x 2x 2x 2x 1x\], after a lit inlane, they will be \[3x 3x 3x 3x 3x\]. This is available at all times, regardless if you have Tyrell’s powerup or not. This can also temporarily increase the combo multiplier to 6x.

**Iron Throne Wizard Mode:**

Completing all of the house modes lights the mode start shot for IT wizard mode. Like HOTK, this multiball is is based on completing sets of shots.

- All of the central house lights that normally signify mode completion turn off at the beginning of the mode.
- The mode starts out as a 2-ball multiball.
- All house shots are lit to start a siege on their castle and light a set of shots.
- Each “set” consists of hitting all 7 house shots. Shots turn off as you complete them.
- The shot that corresponds to the current House’s castle is lit in its House’s color and is worth significantly more points.
- Once all 7 shots have been completed, the battering ram lights for a Super Jackpot + Add-A-Ball.
- Collecting a super jackpot will light that house’s playfield shield to signify completion.
- Start a new set by shooting one of the remaining unlit house’s shots.
- Iron Throne DOES NOT END when you drain down to a single ball.
- Iron Throne DOES NOT END when your ball ends; you pick up where you left off on the following ball (but in single-ball play)!
- Martell’s Add-A-Ball can be used at ANY time, including in single-ball play!
- After completing the last main castle, you will receive one last added ball. You will then go through various other castles and cities and collect “victory lap” shots until you are down to one ball, at which point Iron Throne ends. (speculation: does this phase have an end?)
- All modes will reset after Iron Throne. Also, if you are playing as House Greyjoy or Targaryen, you do *not* get its mode for free the second time around.

**Casual mode settings**

*In recent updates, Casual Mode is set to off by default.*

- Players will not be able to choose a house at the start of the game. Players will start with House Stark.
- STARK starts complete so they are one house closer to EXTRA BALL
- GREYJOY starts lit.
- No option to PASS on choose your battle
- If only one house is lit the house will start without a prompt during CHOOSE YOUR BATTLE
- Flashing effects will be set to the less intense setting.

Difficulty, HOME, and Directors Cut INSTALLS will change the setting.

Holding the right flipper button for 3 seconds before starting a game will allow the game to start NOT in casual mode if desired. If you are approaching a machine in the wild, it may be wise to quickly flipper through the attract mode. If casual mode is **on**, one of the screens will be a description of how to enable “advanced play”. If you do not see this screen, casual mode is **off**.

**Upper Playfield**

The Premium and the LE both have an upper playfield, which consists of two flippers, a scoop where the ball may enter from, three touch targets surrounding two back lanes (where the ball will fall into the left loop), a left castle “mini-loop,” and two rubber bits going up the upper playfield to serve as slingshots. In addition, since the switch used to validate the right ramp is hanging into the upper playfield, hitting the wire gate hard enough will spot you right ramp shots.

**Castle Multiball**

During regular play, the upper playfield is used to advance towards Castle Multiball. Completing a set of 3 targets and then shooting the ball out a back lane collects “Archers!”, “Charge”, “Breach” and “Castle Multiball” in that order. After collecting one bit of progress a drop target will rise in front of the Right Ramp. Shooting the drop target or starting a mode/multiball will drop the target.

Castle Multiball is…honestly something that not many players seek, so if anyone has any information on it fill me in here. <img src="//tiltforums.com/images/emoji/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" alt=":sweat_smile:" />

**Upper Playfield During Modes**

During modes, the upper playfield is used to collect Castles and advance in the modes. At any point, shooting the Castle loop awards certain things in a mode (see below). In addition, hitting one of the 3 lit targets lights the outer targets and awards 5 seconds on the current mode(s). Hitting one of the outer targets lights the center target and gives another 5 seconds. Hitting the center target awards 5 more seconds and lights the castle loop, and collecting the castle gives 15M up front, 7.5M in bonus (!), and lights extra shots on the upper playfield for the following awards:

- Stark: 1 Advance value (just like a ramp shot). Collecting the castle also lights the targets.

- Baratheon: Build Baratheon Jackpot. Collecting the castle also lights the targets.

- Greyjoy: Does nothing before the castle is collected, but lights the back lanes to spot a currently-lit shot afterwards.

- Lannister: 1 Advance value (just like a lit gold target shot). Allows value to go beyond the usual maximum. Collecting the castle also lights the targets.

- Martell: Build Martell Hurry-Up. Collecting the castle also lights the targets. If the hurry-up is running, points are added on.

- Tyrell: Does nothing before the castle is collected, but lights the back lanes to spot the current lit shot afterwards.

- Targaryen 1/2: Build Targaryen Hurry-Up. Collecting the castle also lights the targets.

- Targaryen 3: Build Targaryen Hurry-Up. Collecting the castle also lights the targets, which do damage to the dragon as well (just like 1 hurry-up collect).

Spinner Rule:

There are 9 levels to the spinner.

- You can only increase the level of your spinner up to how many house modes you have completed plus one.
- When the spinner value is increased the value grows based on what level your spinner is at. Each level grows the spinner faster.
- Each ball the spinner starts a level one.
- Completing the three bank of targets bumps you to the next level.
- Each drop target hit increases the value of the spinner.
- Hitting the battering ram sometimes also increases the value of the spinner.
