Designed by Brian Eddy with rules and software by Dwight Sullivan, ***Venom*** depicts the chaotic symbiote attaching to hosts and thwarting Carnage’s attempts to revive Knull, the deity behind the symbiotes’ creation. The game was designed from the ground up with Insider Connected support and features many rules that carry over between games for registered players.

## <span id="heading--overview"></span>Rules Overview:

- Choose a **host** at the start of the game, at the start of each ball, and after completing a full set of **mini-modes**.
- Shoot the flashing yellow, blue, and white shots to complete **mini-modes**. Mini-modes allow you to light locks for **Mayhem Multiball** and help fill out the grid to light **battles** at the center ramp & give perks for completing full squares of grid inserts.
  - Any mode that starts at the center ramp cannot be started while battles are available. These include multiballs or Carnage modes.
- Shoot the green “lock” shots to lock balls for **Mayhem Multiball**, another way to defeat minor bosses outside of battles. Mayhem locks cannot be collected while battle is lit.
- Lock Carnage back in Ravencroft prison by shooting its captive ball to light **Carnage Multiball** and other modes.
- Shoot the red targets to defeat the **Infected** and shoot for **Doppelganger** at the left loop (Pro) or flyaway targets (Prem / LE). Defeat Doppelganger three times to light **rampage**.
- Complete the bottom lanes enough times to light **mystery**.
- Loop the center ramp, then combo into the lit bell tower target to increase your **playfield multiplier**.

## <span id="heading--layout"></span>Layout:

</div>

## <span id="heading--modesofplay"></span>Modes of Play:

These modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:

- **Standard:**  
  See below for full rulesheet.
- **Competition:**  
  Same as *Standard* but with elements of randomness removed.
- **Cooperative:**  
  All players are on the same team. All scores, completed **mini-modes**, and **XP** are shared between players.
- **Team Play:**  
  Adds the scores of two different sets of players for team play. The highest score wins.
- **Impossible:**  
  Extra balls are disabled, game rules are set to “very hard”, and flippers cannot be held for over 2 seconds. For the best of the best players.
- **Monster:**  
  Player 1 plays in impossible mode; everyone else plays with regular rules.
- **Challenge:**  
  Practice defeating **Knull** at different levels and with different boxes on the grid completed.
- **DJ Mixer**  
  NOT a gameplay mode. This mode operates like a jukebox, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists.

## <span id="heading--hosts"></span>Host Selection / Skill Shots:

At the start of each ball, the player will be prompted to select a host, as Venom cannot exist without a being to feed off of. Hosts change the rules of the game, making certain rules easier or more difficult, changing the layout (*Prem / LE exclusive*) and also change the game’s large selection of music.

Hosts can also be changed during a ball by completing any host’s column of **[mini-modes](#heading--minimodes)**, or after the first host change of a ball, completing that host’s **[battle mode](#heading--battles)**, then shooting the left ramp. The four hosts available at the start of the game are:

<div class="md-table">

| Name | Perks | Skill Shots | **[Mayhem](#heading--mayhem)** Locks Lit | Combo Level | Signature Combo | Shot Positions (Prem / LE) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Eddie Brock** | **[Mayhem Multiball](#heading--mayhem)** is more valuable | Left loop (spot **[mini-mode](#heading--minimodes)**), right orbit (points) | 2 | Average | Center ramp - left ramp - left loop - right orbit | 180 ramp shot, right loop feeds back sinkhole |
| **Flash Thompson** | **[Sleeper](#heading--teamups)** unlocked, extra-wide **[bell tower](#heading--pfx)**, **[million plus pops](#heading--pops)** access (Prem / LE) | Scoop (light **[mystery](#heading--mystery)**), right orbit (spot **[mini-mode](#heading--minimodes)**) | 0 | Poor | Right loop - scoop - left ramp - scoop | Target in place of left loop, right loop feeds left orbit entrance |
| **Gwen Stacy** | 2x **[infected](#heading--infected)** defeated, more valuable **[doppelganger attacks](#heading--doppelganger)**, **[Quick Doppelganger Multiball](#heading--quickmb)** access (Prem / LE) | Left loop (spot **[mini-mode](#heading--minimodes)**), right loop (start **[doppelganger](#heading--doppelganger)**) | 1 | Good | Left loop - center ramp - left loop - left ramp | Same as Pro |
| **Peter Parker** | **[Miles Morales](#heading--teamups)** unlocked, **[Carnage modes](#heading--carnage)** easier and more valuable | Left loop (spot **[mini-mode](#heading--minimodes)**), scoop (light **[mystery](#heading--mystery)**) | 1 | Good | Left orbit - left ramp - left loop - scoop | 180 ramp shot, right loop feeds left orbit entrance |

</div>

Unlockable Characters

Additional hosts can be unlocked by winning **[the final battle against Knull](#heading--boss)**, and are not available in competitive play to prevent unfair advantages between players. These hosts correspond to two lines on the **[grid](#heading--minimodes)** instead of one.

<div class="md-table">

| Name | Perks | Skill Shots | **[Mayhem](#heading--mayhem)** Locks Lit | Combo Level | Signature Combo | Shot Positions (Prem / LE) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Venomized Hulk** | Action button lit for **[HULK SMASH!](#heading--spidersense)**, extra-wide **[bell tower](#heading--pfx)**, **[million plus pops](#heading--pops)** access (Prem / LE) | Scoop (light **[mystery](#heading--mystery)**), right orbit (spot **[mini-mode](#heading--minimodes)**) | 0 | Poor | Right orbit - scoop - left orbit - left ramp | Target in place of left loop, right loop feeds left orbit entrance |
| **Venomized Captain America** | **[Mystery](#heading--mystery)** always awards “all of the above”, more valuable **[battle modes](#heading--battles)** | Scoop (light **[mystery](#heading--mystery)**), right orbit (spot **[mini-mode](#heading--minimodes)**) | 1 | Poor | Left loop - center ramp - left orbit - left ramp | Right loop feeds left orbit entrance |
| **Venomized Wolverine** | Longer **ball save** timers, 2x **[infected](#heading--infected)** defeated, **[Quick Doppelganger Multiball](#heading--quickmb)** access (Prem / LE) | Left loop (spot **[mini-mode](#heading--minimodes)**), scoop (light **[mystery](#heading--mystery)**) | 2 | Average | Left orbit - left ramp - scoop - center ramp | Same as Pro |

</div>

And one final host is available if the topper is installed. This host must complete the far left and far right grid lines to light battle. Players signed in with Insider Connected who have played a copy with the topper can use this character for up to 3 months afterwards, even if the topper isn’t installed.

<div class="md-table">

| Name | Perks | Skill Shots | **[Mayhem](#heading--mayhem)** Locks Lit | Combo Level | Signature Combo | Shot Positions (Prem / LE) |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **Venomized Ghost Rider** | Starts with **[flamethrower](#heading--minimodes)** if chosen as first host |  |  |  |  | Left ramp - left loop - right loop - right orbit |

</div>

All hosts also have the standard skill shot option of plunging into the flashing rollover lane for **[+2 bonus X](#heading--bonus)**. It can be changed with the other options with the right flipper, and if the host is changed during a ball at the left ramp, either skill shot listed in the above grids can be scored as a “bonus shot”.

Plunge the ball into the saucer at the apex of the orbit for a Secret Hideout Skill Shot worth 3M +500k per skill shot and +4x bonus. This hidden skill shot is available for all hosts, but disables all other skill shot opportunities.

## <span id="heading--minimodes"></span>Mini-Modes & The Grid:

After selecting a host, three mini-modes are available. These are simple, two-shot combos marked by the flashing arrows - colored, from top to bottom, yellow, blue, and white. Shoot any flashing arrow, then quickly shoot the shot of the same color that times out.

The mini-modes for each host are:

<div class="md-table">

| Host | Yellow | Blue | White |
|----|----|----|----|
| **Eddie Brock** | Left ramp - left loop | Center ramp - left orbit | Right orbit - scoop |
| **Flash Thompson** | Left orbit - left ramp | Right loop - right orbit | Scoop - center ramp |
| **Gwen Stacy** | Right loop - left orbit | Left ramp - scoop | Left loop - center ramp |
| **Peter Parker** | Center ramp - left ramp | Left loop - scoop | Right orbit - left orbit |

</div>

Unlockable Characters' Mini Modes

**Venomized Hulk** \| Right orbit - right loop \| Scoop - left orbit \| Center ramp - left ramp  
**Venomized Captain America** \| Left ramp - right loop \| Left loop - right orbit \| Scoop - center ramp  
**Venomized Wolverine** \| Center ramp - left loop \| Scoop - left orbit \|  
**Venomized Ghost Rider** \| Left loop - scoop \| Center ramp - left ramp \| Right orbit - left orbit

“Default” hosts only need to complete one column of mini-modes to qualify their battle. “Unlockable” hosts need to complete two.

Each mini-mode completed progresses the host’s path seen above the flippers and lights a lock for **[Mayhem Multiball](#heading--mayhem)**. After completing all three inserts on the path by playing all three mini-modes, the player will be able to change hosts at the left ramp if this was the first column completed this ball, or - if at **[level 10](#heading--xp)** - start a **[battle mode](#heading--battles)** by shooting the center ramp. **[Mayhem multiball](#heading--mayhem)** locks cannot be lit or collected, and **[Carnage modes](#heading--carnage)** cannot be started while a battle mode is lit.

Additional bonus awards are listed between the grid inserts and are made available if the player completes a square of four inserts. These perks are disabled if any of their inserts are reset by failing a battle mode. Defeating Knull also resets the entire grid, disabling all perks. From top to bottom, left to right, these are:

- Extra Time (longer timers)
- **[+1x Playfield](#heading--pfx)**
- 2x Web Combos (**[combo level](#heading--combos)** increments by 2 instead of 1)
- Flamethrower (if three adjacent shots are lit, flamethrower will light at the center shot and count all three)
- Extra Ball Save (longer ball save timers at the start of the ball and multiball modes)
- **[2x Experience](#heading--xp)**

## <span id="heading--battles"></span>Battle Modes:

Battles are the main objective of Venom. After completing a path of **[mini-modes](#heading--minimodes)** and getting to at least **[level 10](#heading--xp)**, Battle Modes will become available at the center ramp and the player will be able to **[change hosts](#heading--hosts)** at the left ramp. While a battle mode is lit, **[Mayhem multiball](#heading--mayhem)** locks cannot be lit or collected, and **[Carnage modes](#heading--carnage)** cannot be started.

Battle modes require the player to deplete the boss’ two health bars by making the flashing shots, with certain shots doing more damage than others and the scoop available for Special Attack (5x damage) through different methods in each battle. More time can be added by shooting the bell tower. The second phase will always be the same as the first phase, but with increased difficulty (ie. less shots, stricter timers, etc). Timers for each phase also lower as you unlock more and more hosts.

- **Riot**: Red shots and blue shots move from left to right, and right to left, respectively. Shoot both to deal damage, or make shots when both colors are lit to deal large damage and light Special Attack.
- **Agony**: Make two shots to the flashing red shots for large damage and lit Special Attack, and try to prevent the green shots from taking over by shooting them when one lights. Shoot the bell tower to relight shots.
- **Phage**: Left ramp and right orbit are lit – the left ramp starts a combo sequence to deal large damage, while the right orbit lights the bell tower to shift into shooting the three center shots for damage. Special Attack – make all three center shots.
- **Lasher**: Shoot the left and right orbits, with the shots near them doing smaller damage. Lasher leaps between orbits so keep track of where the symbiote is. Special Attack – make enough shots to either orbit.

Each boss can also be defeated by bringing them into **[Mayhem Multiball](#heading--mayhem)** and scoring the super jackpot - the order of defeated bosses is dependent on the order that the balls were locked in. “Change Host” will not light at the left ramp if bosses are defeated this way, only if the player completes a column of **mini-modes** (once per ball) or either plays or fails the **battle mode** that follows.

Defeat all four minor bosses to qualify **[Hybrid](#heading--teamups)**.

Defeat one minor boss (two for unlockable hosts) and level up to level 20 to qualify **[Grendel](#heading--boss)** as the next Battle Mode; defeat Grendel and level up to level 30 to enable the final fight against **[Knull](#heading--knull)**.

Failing a battle resets the mini-mode path needed to light the battle.

## <span id="heading--doppelganger"></span>Doppelganger Attacks:

Shoot any flashing red target and then quickly shoot it again to defeat the **[Infected](#heading--infected)**, but watch out as Doppelganger might attack on the right side of the playfield.

On the Pro model, Doppelganger is defeated virtually by shooting the left loop. On the Premium / LE models, Doppelganger is represented by a 3-bank of flyaway targets. The first time Doppelganger spawns, only one target needs to be hit to defeat it; then two targets, then three, to a maximum of four. Scoring from Doppelganger on the Pro model can be multiplied by **[web combos](#heading--combos)**, but cannot be multiplied on the Premium / LE models.

(*In competition mode, Doppelganger attacks are not random, instead occurring at set intervals of Infected targets. The flashing flyaway target is also predetermined.*)

Defeat three Doppelgangers to light **[Rampage mode](#heading--rampage)**.

### <span id="heading--rampage"></span>Rampage:

Rampage mode is lit at the center ramp after **[defeating three Doppelgangers](#heading--doppelganger)**, when no other modes are currently running.

The player will be given a few seconds to shoot as many blue shots as possible to increase the value for defeating Doppelganger, who will spawn whenever the time for the first phase runs out, accompanied by a short ball save timer. Shoot Doppelganger as many times as possible within the time limit to score the built-up value. Each shot to Doppelganger will briefly pause the timer.

There is no grace period for this mode - as soon as the timer runs out, the mode ends.

### <span id="heading--quickmb"></span>Quick Doppelganger Multiball (Prem / LE):

On Prem / LE models, Doppelganger has his own multiball. If the player’s **[host](#heading--hosts)** is either **Gwen Stacy** or **Venomized Wolverine**, 8 shots to the right loop during single-ball play will lock the ball at the entrance to the left loop. Once the ball has been locked there, quickly shoot the 180 ramp with the new one that launches to score a jackpot and start multiball.

All Doppelganger targets are lit to score a hurry-up value locked in as soon as any of the targets are made. Four shots then light to score jackpots worth the locked-in value. Collect all four jackpots to light the super jackpot at the scoop, worth 4x the value.

## <span id="heading--mayhem"></span>Mayhem Multiball:

The game starts with a few locks for mayhem multiball lit, depending on the **[host](#heading--hosts)** that was chosen. Otherwise, the player must complete **[mini-modes](#heading--minimodes)** to light locks (one more required for each lock, up to three). Mayhem multiball locks cannot be scored if the center ramp is lit to start a **[battle mode](#heading--battles)**; all available battles must be played or lost to start lighting & collecting locks again.

When lock is lit, two shots will be lit green to lock balls - one in the left canister, and one in the right canister. Each canister on the playfield corresponds to a set of awards, with the number of locked balls and their position determining which perks will be in effect for the multiball – you can get credit for any of the four **[battle modes](#heading--battles)** this way, get **[2x experience points](#heading--xp)**, or **[+1x playfield multiplier](#heading--pfx)**. Hold the action button down to abort multiball and lock up to 6 balls if you want to keep going for perks.

Mayhem Multiball is played in two phases:

- With only one ball in play, alternate between the left ramp and the scoop for quick jackpots, worth XP and spotting a jackpot during the second phase. The balls will keep releasing from alternating canisters to allow more quick jackpots to be collected. Once a quick jackpot times out, the player misses a shot, or 9 quick jackpots have been scored, the balls will release. Ball save is active throughout this phase; draining causes the current quick jackpot to immediately time out.
- All shots are lit to score jackpots with the perks listed above active. Make all the lit jackpot shots to score a super jackpot and instantly complete one of the battles brought into multiball (in the order that they were locked in). For subsequent super jackpots, each shot needs to be made twice for double jackpots, then three times for triple jackpots.

If the player lights a super jackpot and fails to collect it before Mayhem Multiball ends, the super jackpot will remain lit for a few seconds before it disappears.

## <span id="heading--carnage"></span>Carnage Multiball & Carnage Modes:

Carnage modes are started by shooting the captive ball enough times to lock Carnage into Ravencroft. Once the captive ball has been sent all the way back, the center ramp will light to start a Carnage mode, awarded in the following order:

- **Carnage Multiball**: Lock Carnage in Ravencroft again by shooting the captive ball to light the super jackpot at the scoop. Making other shots and completing the infected targets score jackpots and increase the super jackpot value.
- **Carnage Hurry-Up**: Get Carnage all the way back to Ravencroft to score a hurry-up value that can be increased by shooting any ramp, or the captive ball.
- **Blood Lust**: Unlike the other modes, this is mutually exclusive. Shoot the blue shots for big points, and maintain your flips by either looping the center ramp followed by a shot to the captive ball (up to three times), or shooting the bell tower, to add more flips to the constantly decreasing counter. Carnage will attack the player if enough time runs out without making a shot, and subtract a large amount of flips.

## <span id="heading--other"></span>Other Scoring:

### <span id="heading--xp"></span>Experience Points:

As the player completes tasks throughout the game, they score experience points and level up. The player’s current level is remembered if they have a registered Stern Insider Connected account, and after beating **[Knull](#heading--boss)** in the final battle, their level will automatically be reset to 1. Leveling up enough allows the player to take on the more difficult battle modes, and deal more damage to bosses. The maximum level is 99.

Leveling up increases the player’s damage output during **[battles](#heading--battles)**.

XP gained can be doubled from one of the **[grid awards](#heading--minimodes)** and by locking 3 balls for **[Mayhem Multiball](#heading--mayhem)** in the left ball lock (for that multiball only).

### <span id="heading--teamups"></span>Team-Ups:

At the start of any multiball or **[battle mode](#heading--battles)**, alongside changing their **[host](#heading--hosts)**, the player will be able to use the flippers and action button to select any team-ups they have available. No team-ups are available at the start of the game; they must be unlocked by achieving the following features.

- **Hybrid** – Beat all four **[battle modes](#heading--battles)** in a game, whether properly or by scoring super jackpots during Mayhem Multiball to gain credit for them. This lights the action button to collect all lit playfield shots and adds +2x to the **[playfield multiplier](#heading--pfx)** for a short time.
- **Sleeper** – Unlocked after defeating every 10 **[Infected](#heading--infected)** and if Flash Thompson (Agent Venom) is chosen as the first **[host](#heading--hosts)** of a game. Press the action button with Sleeper active to either add a ball if multiball is running, or add more time during a timed battle mode. (*During **[Toxin Team-Up](#heading--toxin)**, add-a-ball will be prioritized.*)
- **Miles Morales** – Available by default if Peter Parker (Black Suit Spider-Man) is chosen as the first **[host](#heading--hosts)** of the game, or can be unlocked by scoring a **[4-way combo](#heading--combos)**. While active, all combos increment by 2 instead of 1.

If a team-up was qualified but not used and the player was signed into Stern Insider Connected, the team-up will remain available for the next game. However, whenever a team-up is used, it will be disqualified and must be qualified to be used again.

### <span id="heading--infected"></span>Infected:

Shoot any of the five red targets on the playfield, then shoot the same target again quickly to defeat an Infected and advance towards awards – but look out for potential **[Doppelganger attacks](#heading--doppelganger)**! Doppelganger will attack at seemingly random intervals every few Infected defeated.

- **[Bonus X](#heading--bonus)** at every 4 infected
- **[Sleeper unlocked](#heading--teamups)** at every 10 infected
- Light **[extra ball](#heading--extraballs)** at 15 & 65 infected
- Light **[Scream](#heading--scream)** at 20 & 70 infected

### <span id="heading--scream"></span>Scream:

This video mode is lit at the scoop after defeating enough of the **[Infected](#heading--infected)** (20 the first time). It can also be started from a **[mystery award](#heading--mystery)**. 10M is awarded upon starting video mode and is awarded in the total even if no Infected are defeated during the video mode. The mode points are also affected by **[web combos](#heading--combos)**.

Carnage has sent the Infected to attack Scream. Use the left or right flipper buttons to defeat the ones that spawn on either side, with a 10M bonus for defeating them all and bonus **[experience points](#heading--xp)** for each one defeated. Scream can defeat multiple Infected at once if they are in close proximity to each other and on the same side.

### <span id="heading--pfx"></span>Bell Tower & Playfield X:

To light the bell tower target in the middle of the playfield, make repeated shots to the center ramp. The first lit bell tower requires two ramp shots, then three for the second, etc. Shooting the lit bell tower adds +1x playfield for a limited time, up to a max of 7x playfield. Even if unlit, more shots to the bell tower will add more time.

Two **[hosts](#heading--hosts)**, Flash Thompson and Venomized Hulk, can also shoot the left loop in place of the bell tower to collect any playfield X advances there.

If the player shoots the center ramp at least four times before shooting the lit bell tower, **Bell Tower Frenzy** will start, a fast scoring mode (5k + 500 per bell tower shot). Two additional center ramp loops are required to start subsequent Bell Tower Frenzies.

Untimed playfield X can also be gained through the following:

- +1x Playfield **[grid award](#heading--minimodes)** (as long as the square remains full)
- Locking 3 balls for **[Mayhem Multiball](#heading--mayhem)** in the *right* ball lock, only during your next Mayhem Multiball

### <span id="heading--spidersense"></span>Spider-Sense:

If the player is in danger (ie. any mode is currently running), hold the action button to enable your Spider-Sense and light a random shot white for a short time. Making this random shot will score a hurry-up starting at 25M and help progress any currently active mode, in the following ways:

- Any **[battle mode](#heading--battles)** - lights “special attack”.
- **[Doppelganger](#heading--doppelganger)** - instantly defeats him.
- **[Carnage Multiball](#heading--carnage)** - lights the super jackpot.
- **[Carnage Hurry-Up](#heading--carnage)** - scores the hurry-up at its current value.
- **[Blood Lust](#heading--carnage)** - counts as a shot towards Carnage and adds flips.
- **[Mayhem Multiball](#heading--mayhem)** - collects one set of jackpots, lighting super jackpot if applicable.
- **[Toxin Team-Up](#heading--toxin)** - lights the super jackpot.
- **[Rampage](#heading--rampage)** - collects one full set of shots during the build phase.

This rule is completely absent for **[Venomized Hulk](#heading--hosts)**. Instead, the action button can be pressed to score every shot in the game, once per ball. (*This action takes priority over **[Hybrid](#heading--teamups)**’s super bomb, though the +2x multiplier from the super bomb still applies*).

### <span id="heading--combos"></span>Combos, Shot X & Host Hurry-Up:

Shoot flashing shots in sequence, at any time, to score combos and boost the shot’s corresponding multiplier up to 5x (if a 10-way combo has been reached). Making shots as combos during **[battle modes](#heading--battles)** deals additional damage.

After playing **[Toxin Team-Up](#heading--toxin)**, host combos will be enabled. Each host has a signature combo listed in *[the linked grid](#heading--hosts)* and marked by unique colored shots that, when completed, lights the scoop for Host Hurry-Up. During Host Hurry-Up, complete the signature combo again before time runs out to score the currently displayed value for each shot. The value starts at 20M and each hurry-up increases by the value of the last.

Each host’s signature combo can only be completed once per game.

### <span id="heading--mystery"></span>Mystery:

Mystery is lit at the scoop by completing the bottom lanes three times (completions also increase the **[Carnage Hurry-Up](#heading--carnage)** value). Every subsequent mystery award requires two more bottom lane completions than the last. If **[doppelganger](#heading--doppelganger)** is active, then mystery awards can’t be collected.

Mystery lists three awards, with the fourth award *always* being “all of the above”, from the following pool:

- Complete any **[grid box](#heading--minimodes)**
- **[Light Carnage](#heading--carnage)**
- **[Increase Carnage Hurry-Up](#heading--carnage)**
- **[Light 3 Locks](#heading--mayhem)**
- **[+1000 XP](#heading--xp)**
- **[+2 or +3 levels](#heading--xp)**
- Unlock any **[team-up](#heading--teamups)**
- Defeat 5 **[infected](#heading--infected)**
- **[Scream](#heading--scream)**
- **[+1x Playfield](#heading--pfx)**
- **[Bell Tower Frenzy](#heading--pfx)**
- Increase **Bell Tower Frenzy**
- Light two **mysteries**
- Big points (5M)
- Bigger points (10M)
- **[+1x, +2x, or +3x bonus](#heading--bonus)**
- Light **[extra ball](#heading--extraballs)** (percentage-based)
- Special (percentage based)

If the player’s current **[host](#heading--hosts)** is Captain America, mystery will always award “all of the above”!

(*In competition mode, mystery awards are scored in a set order.*)

### <span id="heading--pops"></span>Million Plus Pops (Prem / LE):

If the player’s current **[host](#heading--hosts)** is either Flash or Hulk, 8 shots to the target below the U-turn ramp will start a timed period where all pop bumper hits are worth 1M x the current **[playfield multiplier](#heading--pfx)** until time runs out. While million plus pops is running, all orbit shots send balls to the bumpers as well.

### <span id="heading--extraballs"></span>Extra Balls:

Extra ball is lit at the scoop by:

- Defeating enough **[Infected](#heading--infected)**
- **[Mystery award](#heading--mystery)** (rare, percentage-based)

### <span id="heading--bonus"></span>End-of-Ball Bonus:

Bonus is calculated from the **[Infected](#heading--infected)** defeated that ball + points corresponding to the **[experience points](#heading--xp)** collected that ball, all multiplied by the bonus X which can be increased by completing the top lanes, defeating Infected, or through top lane skill shots.

## <span id="heading--wizard"></span>Wizard Modes:

### <span id="heading--toxin"></span>Toxin Team-Up (Mini-Wizard Mode):

The scoop lights to start Toxin Team-Up after:

- Starting **[Mayhem Multiball](#heading--mayhem)**
- Starting **[Carnage Multiball](#heading--carnage)**
- Defeating a **[Doppelganger](#heading--doppelganger)**

This mode starts as a single-ball mode, with three random shots lit to award two jackpots (starting at 1M and increasing by 1M per shot) that can be multiplied by 2x or 3x by shooting Carnage – but only for a short time as its position will slowly reset. Scoring all six jackpots lights the super jackpot at the scoop for 25M, and collecting the super jackpot adds another ball to play, turning the mode into 2-ball multiball. Subsequent super jackpots add 25M to the value.

The mode ends if the player drains during the first part of the mode, or whenever the multiball ends.

If **[Sleeper team-up](#heading--teamups)** is selected during this mode’s intro, pressing the flashing action button will always add a ball, even if the player is in the initial single-ball phase.

### <span id="heading--boss"></span>Major Boss Battles:

Two more difficult battle modes can be enabled if the player has already defeated one **[minor boss](#heading--battles)**, and has reached **[level 20](#heading--xp)** (for Grendel) or **[level 30](#heading--xp)** (for Knull). They are started the same way as normal battle modes – complete the required **[mini-modes](#heading--minimodes)** for your current host, and then shoot the center ramp.

- **Grendel**: Shoot any lit shot to light the other shots – excluding the one that was made – for three levels of damage and more time, which can also be added at the bell tower. Shooting any lit red shot, or dealing a large enough amount of damage, lights special attack. If Grendel attacks the player, the flippers will be reversed, and a flashing blue shot must be made to return them to normal. During the fourth health bar, the mode will shift to 2-ball multiball; if one of the balls drains, sudden death will start and the player can no longer add time with bell tower shots.
- **Knull**: Shoot the blue, yellow, and red shots to deal small, medium, and large damage respectively and more time, which can also be added at the bell tower. Shooting any lit red shot lights special attack. For the fifth health bar, 2-ball multiball will begin; if one of the balls drains, sudden death will start and the player can no longer add time with bell tower shots. Defeating Knull increases the player’s **Hero ranking** on Insider Connected, and allows the player to unlock an additional **host** and resets their accumulated **XP**. Beware – at any time during a phase, Knull can screw with the player, turning all shots green and requiring additional shots; dimming the entire playfield; or, worst of all, completely removing the power from a flipper!

### <span id="heading--mania"></span>Symbiote Mania (Topper Mode):

This mode is exclusive to the topper. The player must either own the topper or have played a connected Venom game with it within the last 3 months to access this mode.

Starting each of the four minor bosses (Riot, Agony, Phage, Lasher) is a prerequisite for unlocking Symbiote Mania. Then, with no other mode running, the player must make the center ramp shot to begin.

In Symbiote Mania, all eight characters are played, in random order. The playfield (Prem / LE) morphs between each character. For each one, the player must complete three distinct shots to advance to the next character.

### <span id="heading--klyntar"></span>Klyntar Multiball (Final Wizard Mode):

The center ramp lights for Klyntar Multiball after completing all major objectives in the game:

- **[Defeating Knull in the final battle](#heading--boss)**
- Starting **[Rampage mode](#heading--rampage)**
- Starting the third **[Carnage mode](#heading--carnage)**, **Blood Lust**
- Starting **[Toxin Team-Up](#heading--toxin)**
- Starting **[Scream video mode](#heading--scream)**
- Completing a **[Host Hurry-Up](#heading--combos)**
- Starting **[Bell Tower Frenzy](#heading--pfx)**

Klyntar Multiball is a timed 2-ball multiball with unlimited ball save until the mode ends. The left and center ramps, scoop, and right orbit are lit to score 4-stage hurry-up values that increase in value by the last hurry-up awarded. Each shot also dims the playfield, with the final shot being the only insert flashing on the playfield. Once all 16 hurry-up shots are scored or time runs out, the mode ends, with a bonus for seconds remaining if the mode was completed.
