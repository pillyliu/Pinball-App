## I. INTRODUCTION

<a id="heading--intro-overview"></a>
1.1:  Monster Bash is George Gomez' newest pinball creation.  It is also the
next-to-last WPC (Williams Pinball Controller) game Williams will
produce, as after their next game Cactus Canyon, Williams will introduce
to the world "Pinball 2000" (P2K), whose changes are as yet unknown
to people outside of Williams.  This is also a licensed game, as
Williams licensed some of Universal Pictures' most famous monsters.
Monster Bash is a fairly simple game, presumably designed for someone
other than us wizards.

<a id="heading--playfield-layout"></a>
## II. PLAYFIELD LAYOUT

Yet another game built on the AFM playfield layout.  If you were good at the
shots in AFM and Medieval Madness, you should not have too many problems here.
Call me cynical, but as far as I can tell, George just took the drawings for
AFM, made a few cosmetic changes, and spat out AFM 3.  Several posters on
r.g.p. have expressed that Monster Bash feels like a Brian Eddy game (designer
of AFM and MM), so my conclusion that MB is AFM 3 is somewhat justified.

(in usual order, clockwise from center drain)

- Left flipper and slingshot:
        Normal.

- Left inlane:
        Normal-sized, but can be lit for "Phantom Flip".  More on this
        later.

- Left outlane:
        Normal.  Can be lit for special.

- Creature from the Black Lagoon:
        Under-the-playfield toy which glows green whenever you shoot
        the...

- Creature's Black Lagoon:
        A lane that's in the exact same shape and position as Crazy
        Bob's in NBA Fastbreak and the Tube in No Fear.  Used to start
        and in playing "Creature Feature".

- Left loop:
        Can either feed the jet bumpers or careen around just like in
        AFM.  Used to start and in playing "Full Moon Fever".

- Phantom Flip target #1:
        See "Phantom Flip" later on.

- Left ramp:
        Tight figure-8 ramp that feeds the left inlane.  Used to light
        and in playing "Ball and Chain".  Weak shots will roll back
        down, carom off the above Phantom Flip target, and hit the right
        slingshot.

- Phantom Flip target #2

- Frankenstein:
        2-bank motorized drop target.  Blocks access to the center ramp.
        Used to light and play Frankenstein Multiball.

- Phantom Flip target #3

- Center ramp:
        Protected by Frank.  Feeds the right ramp prior to starting
        Frank Multiball.

- Mosh Pit (center lane):
        A lane much like the Mode Start/NAS Cure lane on Johnny Mnemonic
        and in the same position as AFM's saucer.  Awards various awards
        after so many shots.  Used to light Mosh Pit Multiball.  Used during
        pretty much everything.  Can be shot from either flipper,
        although I think it's easier from the right flipper.

- Tomb Treasure Target:
        A large standup about halfway up the Mosh Pit and offset from
        the lane itself.  Adds +1X bonus X and the same number of points
        that 10 jet bumper hits would score.

- Scoop:
        Fowards-facing-only scoop that awards random awards a la Stroke
        of Luck or Merlin's Magic.  Used to get the extra ball and in
        starting Drac Attack, Mummy Mayhem, Mosh Pit MB, Monster Bash, and
        Monsters of Rock.  No feed from the jet bumpers, but it's got a
        fairly large mouth so direct shots are not necessary.

- Jet bumpers and D-I-G rollover lanes:
        Lanes -- advances the bonus X as normal, and is lit for skill
                shot at the beginning of each ball.  Successful skill shots
                award 100K+50K points and a Monster Bomb (think Martian
                and Troll bombs.  More on these later.)  Spelling D-I-G
                raises the jet value by 1500 and spots 5 hits on the jets.
        Jets -- advances toward lighting Mummy Mayhem and starting
                Mummy Jets (a.k.a. super jets), both occuring at 60 jet hits.
                During super/mummy jets, the jet values are doubled.

- Right ramp:
        Flat ramp which loops around and feeds the right inlane.  Weak
        shots will fall back and normally hit the left flipper.

- Right loop:
        Same as left loop.

- Dracula's loop:
        A semicircle in the playfield on which Dracula travels.  (Drac
        says, "I will mezzzzzzzmerizzzze you with my semicircular
        movements!")

- Dracula's coffin:
        Where Drac rests when Drac Attack, Monster Bash, and Monsters of
        Rock are not active.

- "Drac" and "Attack" standups:
        In the same position as the "AN" martian in AFM.  Used to light
        Drac Attack.

- Right outlane, inlane, and slingshot:
        Same as left.

- Plunger:
        Automatic.  It's also how you use the monster bombs.

<a id="heading--objective-and-modes"></a>
## III. OBJECTIVE AND MODES

The objective is to collect the 6 monsters' instruments to light
Monsters of Rock multiball. To collect the instruments, you must
complete the modes, not merely play them. Playing all 6 modes lights
a mini wizard mode, Monster Bash.

All modes are timed modes. Modes stop when (1) they are completed,
(2) they time out, or (3) the ball drains, whichever occurs first.

<a id="heading--mode-creature-feature"></a>
### 3.1. Creature Feature (20 seconds and hurry-up)

Similar to Royal Madness in Medieval Madness. Shoot all major shots
(both loops, both ramps, and the Mosh lane) in any order before time
runs out. The first shot is a 1M hurry-up; subsequent shots score
2X, 3X, 4X, and 5X the hurry-up value (maximum 5M). Creature Feature
ends on the 5th shot.

You have 20 seconds to shoot each shot; the timer resets to 20 after
each shot. The Black Lagoon and a spear gun (see Monster Bombs) will
each spot one shot, end the hurry-up if active, and reset the timer,
like the super jackpot or lock shot during Royal Madness in Medieval
Madness. The Black Lagoon may be shot multiple times during Creature
Feature; the lane spotted starts at the first lit lane and proceeds
clockwise.

Completing Creature Feature awards the Creature from the Black Lagoon's
saxophone.

Some quotes:
- "He's so cute and slimy."
- "Amphibians rule!"
- "You're an awesome amphibian!"
- "Wrap your flippers around me, fish-boy!"

<a id="heading--mode-full-moon-fever"></a>
### 3.2. Full Moon Fever (4 hurry-ups)

Shoot both loops four times collectively. Those balls will end up in
the jet bumpers. Once Full Moon Fever is started, however, balls will
careen around, so watch out.

Upon starting Full Moon Fever, a 1M hurry-up is lit on both loops.
Shoot to collect and reset the hurry-up to 2M, 3M, and 4M. Either loop
will qualify for any Full Moon Fever shot, but the ball must completely
loop around (it does not count if the ball lands in the jet bumpers).
All hurry-ups stop at 250K for a few seconds and then expire.

Collect all 4 hurry-ups during one Full Moon Fever to get the
Wolfman's drums. A Monster Bomb awards the current hurry-up, starts
the next one, and spots one loop. The hurry-up value increases by
250K per completed Full Moon Fever (for example, Full Moon Fever #2
scores 1.25M, then 2.25M, then 3.25M, and so on).

If Full Moon Fever and Mummy Mayhem are active concurrently, the
controlled gates will divert the ball to the jet bumpers, so it will
not careen around. Shots will still count.

Some quotes:
- "NO, I will NOT be your date to the concert!"
- "But I've had all my shots."
- "Get away from me, you fleabag!"

<a id="heading--mode-ball-and-chain"></a>
### 3.3. Ball and Chain (up to four 30-second increments)

Shoot each ramp three times to start, and then shoot them each three
times more to collect the Bride of Frankenstein's microphone. The
timer may be reset to 30 seconds up to three times by shooting the
Mosh Pit lane.

Both ramps score 2X the Ball and Chain value (starts at 500K), and
the Mosh Pit lane scores 1X. Once the Bride's microphone is collected,
all scoring is tripled until the timer runs out. Time can still be
extended by shooting the Mosh Pit.

A Monster Bomb spots one ramp shot, alternating between the right
and left ramps, starting on the right.

Some quotes:
- "Tall, dark, handsome. NOT!"
- "It's outta here!"
- "I heard he's got a monstrous organ."
- "Somebody stop me!"

With the 3X scoring once the mode is completed, Ball and Chain can be
very lucrative during multiballs, especially since the timers are
stopped (see Timers Stop During Multiball).

<a id="heading--mode-frankenstein"></a>
### 3.4. Frankenstein Multiball

Assemble Frankenstein by shooting him 7 times. He will then raise up
and expose the center ramp; shoot it to start Frankenstein Multiball.

Frankenstein Multiball is a 3-ball multiball whose objective is to beat
up on Frankenstein. Collect 6 super, double super, and or triple super
jackpots by hitting Frankenstein to collect his keyboard.

Frankenstein scores super, double super, and triple super jackpots.
Every other major shot scores a normal jackpot (base value 400K).
Double and triple super jackpots are lit by shooting regular jackpots
before shooting a super jackpot. A double super requires two
intervening jackpots, and a triple super requires three.

Jackpots are increased by 50K and super jackpots are increased by
250K each time you complete Frankenstein during multiball. Double
supers count as two shots to Frankenstein, and triple super jackpots
count as three.

A flaming torch (see Monster Bombs) will spot the next lit super
jackpot, including double and triple supers if they are lit, so a
flaming torch will spot anywhere from one to three hits on
Frankenstein.

The way Frankenstein registers hits is a metal bar attached to his
torso that hits a microswitch. Over time, the microswitch that
registers hits on Frankenstein may get bent or otherwise break. The
Phantom Flip targets on either side of Frankenstein will compensate
when Frankenstein is broken.

If you did not get the keyboard during multiball, Frankenstein will
raise up and re-expose the center ramp to restart Frankenstein
monoball. This is the last chance analog of the super jackpot sudden
death in Attack From Mars or the Battle for the Kingdom sudden death
in Medieval Madness.

You have 15 seconds to pound away on Frankenstein and get the
remaining amount of super jackpots to spot the keyboard. Each hit
on Frankenstein restarts the timer at 15 seconds. Regular jackpots
may still be collected and will still light double and triple super
jackpots.

The last chance will remain active if Mosh Pit Multiball is started,
and presumably also during Monster Bash, but you must start last
chance before starting the multiball.

Some quotes:
- (Igor) "What a torso! What's a torso?"
- (Igor) "You put your left leg in."
- (Scientist) "This is no time to do the hokey pokey!"
- (Scientist) "Get ready when I flip the switch!"

The light show to start Frankenstein Multiball is impressive.

<a id="heading--mode-mummy-mayhem"></a>
### 3.5. Mummy Mayhem (45 seconds)

Think of a one-ball Rule the Universe. You have to score 7.5M points
within 45 seconds. All switches score 50K, and jets are tripled
(minimum 30K).

Each major shot is lit for a mayhem jackpot, whose score is 500K plus
all switches since the last mayhem jackpot, similar to Fear Fest on
No Fear. Score at least 7.5M to collect the Mummy's bass.

Mummy Mayhem is started at the scoop. A Monster Bomb here spots one
mayhem jackpot. Getting a multiball running concurrently with Mummy
Mayhem makes this mode much easier.

Completing Mummy Mayhem before time runs out awards a bonus of
250K multiplied by the number of seconds remaining. For example, if
you complete Mummy Mayhem in 35 seconds, leaving 10 seconds, you get
a bonus of 2.5M.

Subsequent Mummy Mayhems require an additional 500K per completed
Mayhem to complete.

The quotes to start and during this mode are particularly humorous.

<a id="heading--mode-drac-attack"></a>
### 3.6. Drac Attack (30 seconds)

Spell D-R-A-C-U-L-A by hitting the two red "Drac" and "Attack"
standup targets on the right side of the playfield 7 times
collectively.

Once started at the scoop, Dracula will come out of his coffin and
move around periodically. Each time you hit Dracula, the timer
resets to 30 seconds. Hit him five times to collect his guitar.

If you hit Dracula while he is moving, you will score double the
Drac value, but you will only receive one hit. The Monster Bomb
spots one hit on Dracula. If you use the Monster Bomb when Dracula
is moving, you still receive the double score but only one hit.

D-R-A is spotted for you at the beginning of the game.

Some quotes:
- "Back off, I'm the lead guitarist!"
- "Hey, those are my Bruno Maglis!"
- "Do you think you can hit dis bat with dat ball?"

<a id="heading--mode-extra-ball"></a>
### 3.7. Extra Ball and Special

Collecting a predetermined amount of monsters, usually three, will
light an Extra Ball. Collecting a predetermined amount of
instruments, usually four, will light the Special on alternating
outlanes.

The Extra Ball remains lit until collected. The Special is only
active for the current ball and alternates outlanes each time a
slingshot fires.

<a id="heading--mode-monster-bombs"></a>
### 3.8. Monster Bombs

Monster Bombs are the same concept as Martian Bombs in Attack From
Mars. They spot one hit or shot toward collecting the monster's
instrument.

The Monster Bombs and their corresponding monsters are:
- Garlic clove: Dracula
- Hair dryer: Bride of Frankenstein
- Ancient scroll: Mummy
- Silver bullet: Wolfman
- Spear gun: Creature from the Black Lagoon
- Flaming torch: Frankenstein

Monster Bombs can be collected by skill shot, by making 3 plus 6
(that is, 3, 9, 15, 21, and so on) Mosh Pit shots, or as an award
from the scoop. Garlic cloves may also be collected by spelling
D-R-A-C-U-L-A additional times prior to starting Drac Attack.

<a id="heading--mode-instrument-bonus"></a>
### 3.9. Instrument Bonus

Each time you collect an instrument, all major shots (both loops,
both Bride ramps, and the Mosh Pit) light for Instrument Bonus. This
is Monster Bash's equivalent of victory laps after Rule the Universe
in Attack From Mars.

Instrument Bonus scores 900K plus 100K multiplied by the number of
instruments collected on that ball. Completing a subsequent
instrument relights all shots and raises the Instrument Bonus value.
Shooting the Mosh Pit lane relights all shots but does not increase
the Instrument Bonus value.

Instrument Bonuses will light during multiballs, and any Instrument
Bonuses active prior to starting multiball will remain lit. Instrument
Bonuses are only active for the ball on which the corresponding
instrument was received.

<a id="heading--multiballs"></a>
## IV. MULTIBALLS

<a id="heading--mb-mosh-pit"></a>
### 4.1. Mosh Pit

Light Mosh Pit Multiball by shooting the center lane six times. It is
started at the scoop. Initially, this is a two-ball multiball. Up to
two additional balls may be added, each with a fresh but short ball
saver, by shooting the center lane again.

Jackpots are worth 750K plus 5K multiplied by the number of Mosh Pit
shots. The jackpot value caps at 1.5M. All shots (Black Lagoon, both
loops, all three ramps, and the Mosh Pit) score a Mosh Pit jackpot.

Ten shots to Frankenstein score a Mosh Pit Super Jackpot, whose value
is a function of the regular jackpots collected, typically around
7M to 10M. After collecting the Super Jackpot, Frankenstein’s red
standup targets will raise up. Shoot them five times to collect the
second Super Jackpot, which is three times the current Mosh Pit
jackpot value.

After that, shoot Frankenstein’s ramp ten times to relight the first
Super Jackpot again, then the standups five times for the second
Super Jackpot, and repeat this cycle. Mosh Pit Multiball is also lit
at the 24th Mosh Pit shot during regular single-ball play.

<a id="heading--mb-monster-bash"></a>
### 4.2. Monster Bash

Start, but not necessarily complete, all six monsters’ modes to light
Monster Bash at the scoop. Monster Bash is a four-ball multiball.

Each monster shot is worth 2M. The center lane is lit for Bash
Jackpots worth 2M plus 500K multiplied by the number of monsters
bashed since the last Bash Jackpot, with a maximum value of 7.5M.
Monster Bash has a generous ball saver.

Monster Bash is lit as soon as the sixth monster’s mode is started.
Subsequent Monster Bashes increase the monster value by 500K.
Monster Bash is Monster Bash’s equivalent of Total Annihilation in
Attack From Mars.

<a id="heading--mb-monsters-of-rock"></a>
### 4.3. Monsters of Rock (wizard mode)

Collect all six monsters’ instruments by completing their respective
modes. Shoot the scoop to start Monsters of Rock.

Each instrument, which may be collected multiple times prior to
starting Monsters of Rock, is worth 5M. There is a 25M bonus for each
complete set of instruments. This bonus is cumulative throughout the
game.

For example, the first Monsters of Rock will award at least 55M
(25M plus six instruments at 5M each). The second Monsters of Rock
will award at least 110M, and so on. If you start Monsters of Rock
without previously starting Monster Bash, you receive an additional
50M bonus. This bonus is awarded for starting Monsters of Rock.

Monsters of Rock itself is a four-ball multiball with each monster
shot worth 4M and a very generous ball saver.

Every time you shoot all monster shots (the Black Lagoon, both loops,
both ramps, and Frankenstein once each), you receive the Monsters of
Rock jackpot. The jackpot value is 4M multiplied by the number of
monster completions.

The Mosh Pit will spot one additional monster toward the Monsters of
Rock jackpot per shot, typically starting from the Creature and
working clockwise. Each subsequent Monsters of Rock increases each
monster value by 1M, so each monster shot becomes worth 5M.

If you start Monster Bash and complete all remaining instruments
during Monster Bash, Monsters of Rock will automatically start with
a fresh ball saver and Monsters of Rock scoring. Starting Monsters of
Rock automatically terminates any active modes without completing
them.

<a id="heading--mb-champions"></a>
### 4.4. Monster Bash and Monsters of Rock Champions

If your Monster Bash or Monsters of Rock score is high enough, you
will be the Monster Bash or Monsters of Rock Champion.

Only the points accumulated during the multiball itself count toward
champion status. The bonus points awarded for starting Monsters of
Rock, such as the 25M instrument set bonus or the additional 50M for
starting Monsters of Rock before Monster Bash, do not count toward
your Monsters of Rock champion total.

Most likely, you will not receive a free credit for being a Monster
Bash or Monsters of Rock Champion.

<a id="heading--mb-timers"></a>
### 4.5. Timers Stop During Multiball

As the animations clearly state, any and all active timers are
stopped during multiball. However, you can still play any active
modes.

Whether this behavior is a bug or an intentional feature is unclear,
but it can be exploited. Use Frankenstein Multiball, Mosh Pit
Multiball, and or Monster Bash Multiball to help complete modes and
collect instruments.

If you have a multiball lit, it is advantageous to start at least one
mode before starting the multiball.

<a id="heading--mb-commentary"></a>
### 4.6. Commentary

Monster Bash and Monsters of Rock multiballs are unbalancing to this
game. If you can keep them going for a long time and start several of
them over the course of a game, scores of 1.5 billion or even
2 billion are possible.

The author reports achieving a Monsters of Rock worth over 400M, with
a total game score of 661M, meaning Monsters of Rock accounted for
approximately 60 percent of the total score.

<a id="heading--scoop-awards"></a>
## V. SCOOP AWARDS

Each shot to the scoop awards a random award, similar to Stroke of Luck
in Attack From Mars. Each award is “featured,” as in a rock band, at a
monstrous venue somewhere in the world. Williams renamed common venues
with monstrous names such as Wolfstock, Fillgore East and West, and
Cadaver Club. See also Lyman’s Lament.

Awards observed include:
- Points: 50K, 75K, or 100K
- Light Extra Ball
- Light Drac Attack
- Light Mummy Mayhem
- Start a monster’s mode
- Advance toward starting a monster’s mode
- Award a monster bomb
- Hold Bonus X

“Advance Mummy” spots 10 hits on the jet bumpers. “Advance” for any
other monster spots one shot or hit. “Advance Bride” alternates which
ramp is spotted, unless one ramp is already completed.

<a id="heading--miscellaneous"></a>
## VI. MISCELLANEOUS

<a id="heading--misc-phantom-flip"></a>
### 6.1. Phantom Flip

By hitting the three Phantom Flip targets seven times collectively, a
stackable number of Phantom Flips can be lit on the inlanes. Phantom
Flip is the return of Thing Flips.

Monster Bash uses artificial intelligence to flip the flipper for you,
attempting what the game believes is the best shot. In practice,
Phantom Flip often fails to make the shot cleanly, and the ball may
carom elsewhere. Over many plays, the system may improve, as it
appears to be “trained.”

Every seven hits on the Phantom Flip targets spots two Phantom Flips.
Phantom Flips are stackable and carry over from ball to ball. After one
is used, the remaining flips light on the opposite inlane and may be
switched by hitting the flippers.

<a id="heading--misc-extra-balls"></a>
### 6.2. Extra Balls

Extra Balls can be lit by:
- Collecting enough monsters
- Completing 12 Mosh Pits
- Receiving a Scoop Award

The monster Extra Ball is available after every Monster Bash, similar
to the castle Extra Ball after Battle for the Kingdom in Medieval
Madness. The instrument Special is one-time only; if not collected, it
is lost for the remainder of the game.

The Extra Ball animation shows Dracula dancing and being squashed by a
disco ball. Dracula normally announces “Extra ball,” but if Full Moon
Fever is running, the Wolfman will howl it instead.

<a id="heading--misc-lymans-lament"></a>
### 6.3. Lyman’s Lament

After shooting the scoop 43 times during normal (non-multiball) play,
the 44th scoop award is Lyman’s Lament, which is intended to be a
special feature. Lyman Sheats himself provides the speech.

There is a cheat code to start Lyman’s Lament without shooting the
scoop 44 times. Start the game with at least one credit remaining.
Before launching the ball, enter the following flipper code:

11L, 1R, 5L, 1R, 6L, 1R

Launch the ball without draining and shoot the scoop.

<a id="heading--misc-strategy"></a>
### 6.4. Strategy

Multiball is the dominant strategy. Which multiball is less important
than keeping any multiball running for a long time and starting them
while modes are active. Achieving Monster Bash almost guarantees at
least a replay.

OFF.

### 6.6. Easter Eggs and Cool Backglass Stuff

- Elvira and Wonder Woman appear on the backglass to the right of the
  monsters.
- If five monsters or five instruments have been collected, the scoop
  will often start the remaining monster’s mode, sometimes multiple
  times.
- Cows appear in several places:
  - “Cow Palace” venue
  - A cow skeleton on the left side of the Mosh Pit Multiball animation
- Some peasants on the backglass wield unusual farm implements such as
  a Garden Weasel and a shrub trimmer.
- Dracula appears both on stage and in the audience.
- A DOHO appears in the graveyard when Igor picks up pieces of
  Frankenstein’s body.

### 6.7. Canceling Animations

Any animation can be stopped by pressing both flippers simultaneously,
similar to speeding up the bonus count.

## VII. FUN WITH BONUS

The bonus is a switch count multiplied by the Bonus X, similar to
Attack From Mars and Medieval Madness. Achieving a 20X to 30X Bonus X
is fairly easy due to two advancement methods: the D-I-G rollover
lanes and the Tomb Treasure target. Multiballs make this even easier,
as many balls will strike the Tomb Treasure target accidentally.

Because Lyman Sheats also programmed Attack From Mars and Medieval
Madness, it is presumed that the Bonus X maximum is 250X.
