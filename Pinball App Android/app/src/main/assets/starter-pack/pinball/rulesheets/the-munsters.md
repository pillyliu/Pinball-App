## <span id="heading--modesofplay"></span>Modes of Play:

These modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:

- **Standard:**  
  See below for full rulesheet.
- **Competition:**  
  Same as *Standard* but with elements of randomness (ie. Dragula, Kitty) removed.
- **Impossible:**  
  Extra balls are disabled, game rules are set to “very hard”, and flippers cannot be held for over 2 seconds. For the best of the best players.
- **Monster:**  
  Player 1 plays in impossible mode; everyone else plays with regular rules.
- **Couch Potato Challenge:**  
  Unique 2-ball multiball frenzy. Shoot shots to add balls and targets to keep them lit. Ends after 20 shots are made. High scores are kept across players.
- **DJ Mixer**  
  NOT a gameplay mode. This mode operates like a jukebox, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists.

## <span id="heading--skillshots"></span>Skill Shots

There are various Skill Shots on this machine, which can be changed using the flippers. All of the skill shots award a base value of 250k, +1 Bonus X, and 25k per second remaining when the skill shot was made.

- Skill Shot - Plunge into the lit lane. The lane can’t be changed, it is always the right lane - which means you have to either plunge lightly or hope the ball enters the right lane on its own. Short plunging directly to the right flipper and shooting the left ramp also scores a Skill Shot.
- Super Skill Shot - Hold in the left flipper button and shoot the right ramp to score a Super Skill Shot for 500k.
- Double Super Skill Shot (Prem/LE) - Hold in both left flipper buttons, then shoot the scoop followed by a shot to the saucer in Grandpa’s Laboratory to score a Double Super Skill Shot for 1M and collect a **[mystery award](#heading--mysteryaward)** if lit.

## <span id="heading--familymembers"></span>Family Members

The main goal of *The Munsters* is to at least start all of the family members’ modes. There are five members to collect: [**Herman**](#heading--herman), [**Spot**](#heading--spot), [**Lily**](#heading--lily), [**Grandpa**](#heading--grandpa), and [**Raven**](#heading--raven). The modes increase in “level” each time they are started.

Each time a member is started, the [**Kitty Target**](#heading--kitty) will be qualified to increase the playfield multiplier, and the Raven advances will be qualified at the left ramp (after the mode has finished). Each level also awards 100k + 25k per level completed, and adds 10k to end-of-ball bonus.

Playing all five modes once will qualify the scoop to start **[Munster Madness](#heading--munstermadness)**.

### <span id="heading--herman"></span>Herman

Shoot Herman an increasing amount of times to begin the mode, though note that the multiball portion can only be played again after starting **[Munster Madness](#heading--munstermadness)**. Beginning Herman Multiball will count as completing a level. Herman’s mode is split into three parts:

- Herman Hurry-Up: Start the Herman Hurry-Up by shooting Herman enough times (only one shot is needed the first time this mode is played, increasing for subsequent attempts). You then have to shoot Herman again for a maximum value of 500k, which will also capture the ball on the magnet in front of him.
  - Monster in the Park Hurry-Up: After the ball has been captured, another ball will be auto-plunged directly to the flippers. Shoot the captured ball to collect 2x the hurry-up value and begin Herman Multiball.
  - Herman Multiball: Whether or not you collect the Monster in the Park Hurry-Up, you will begin Herman Multiball; however, collecting the Monster in the Park Hurry-Up will give you three balls, while failing to collect it will only give you two balls. All of the major shots are lit for Jackpots, and Herman can be shot to re-light collected Jackpots. Shooting Herman 3 times advances the Jackpot value. Hits to Herman also relight one Jackpot at a shot that has been completed already. Collecting 4 Jackpots will qualify the Herman **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**.
  - Level 2 changes: The Monster in the Park Hurry-Up starts at 10x the base value. During the Multiball, the Jackpots aren’t qualified automatically after completing them all; Herman has to be shot three times to advance their level.

### <span id="heading--spot"></span>Spot

Shoot the left or right ramp when they are lit with a red light to collect a SPOT letter and briefly raise Spot from under the left ramp. If Spot is hit during this brief period, you’ll collect a bonus letter in SPOT. Completing SPOT will begin Spot’s mode, and simply starting the mode will count as completing a level. Spot’s mode is divided into two parts:

- Stage 1: Spot raises up from under the left ramp. Shoot Spot four times for increasing awards, but beware the risky feed. Completing all four shots will qualify the Spot **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**. Base shot value is 150k, increasing by 100k per shot.
- Stage 2: If time is still remaining after qualifying the Spot Super Jackpot, the left orbit and right ramp will light up with blue inserts. Shoot either shot to raise Spot once more (with a red insert), and hit it for increasing points. The mode will end after time runs out or if you drain.
  - Level 2 changes - The mode starts from “Stage 2” of the previous level, requiring you to qualify Spot first by shooting the left orbit or right ramp. Hit Spot four times, just like before, to qualify the super jackpot.

### <span id="heading--lily"></span>Lily

Begin Lily’s frenzy mode by completing LILY at the right target. Over time, the progress on the LILY targets will reset if not hit. Simply starting the mode is enough to count as completing a level. Unlike every other mode in the game, Lily’s frenzy CAN be stacked with any other ongoing feature. Make 100 switch hits during the mode to qualify the Lily **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**. If you fail to complete all 100 switch hits (which will likely happen unless you’re in a Multiball), the amount of switch hits will be held over the next time you start this mode.

- Level 2 changes - Shooting the LILY targets is worth a significant amount of points, and switch hits build a bonus value for the next LILY hit.

### <span id="heading--grandpa"></span>Grandpa

Collect enough **[chattering teeth](#heading--teeth)** at the purple targets to light the scoop for Enlarging Ray, or on the Premium / LE, Grandpa’s Laboratory. Simply starting Enlarging Ray is enough to complete a level, while on the Premium / LE, starting Grandpa Multiball will also complete a level. The four targets (and the Machine on the Premium / LE) will also qualify the **[Zap Button](#heading--zapmeter)** for a short time.

**Enlarging Ray** (Pro)

- All shots start out white, and the standup targets will be flashing. Shooting either will qualify one of the major shots for a Jackpot and change its insert color to purple. After qualifying a Jackpot, you don’t have to collect it right away; you can wait until more Jackpots are lit and then collect them all for even higher values. Collecting 4 Jackpots during Enlarging Ray will qualify the Enlarging Ray **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**; simply starting the mode will count as advancing a level.
  - Level 2 changes - Grandpa II requires the player to hit the strobing standup target. While Jackpots can still be lit in the normal fashion, by shooting any shot once, hitting the lit target will qualify ALL unlit Jackpots at once.

**Grandpa’s Laboratory** (Prem/LE)

- Watch the display as it counts down towards the mini playfield’s activation. You’ll hear a callout when the mode begins, advising you to check out the shrunken pinball in Grandpa’s Laboratory. Remember to use the second set of flippers (lower set of flipper buttons)
  - Activate the Machine: You have a set amount of time to activate the Machine by shooting both outer orbits, and then shooting the Machine. Shooting the ramp will add more time and shooting the saucer will collect a **[Mystery Award](#heading--mysteryaward)** and spot one of the orbits. If the timer runs out during this stage, the mode will end and you will have to qualify it again by completing the four targets and hitting the scoop.
  - Grandpa Multiball: When the Machine is activated, Grandpa Multiball will begin, which also counts as completing a level. Shoot all of the flashing shots on the lower playfield for Jackpots, then make the Machine Jackpot to qualify the Grandpa **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**. Before the Machine Jackpot is lit, shooting the Machine advances the value of the other jackpots. After time runs out, the ball will be ejected out of the scoop. Hitting the Machine will also enable the **[Zap Button](#heading--zapmeter)** for a short time.

### <span id="heading--raven"></span>Raven

Completing a level of any of **the four other characters** will qualify the left ramp to collect Raven advances once their mode has ended. Collecting three advances will begin Raven Multiball.

- Raven Multiball: During this 3-ball multiball, the left orbit, left ramp, right ramp, and right orbit are lit to score Jackpots. Triggering switches moves the hands on the clock on the display - when the hour hand moves to a new digit (ie. a certain number of switches are made), the Jackpot value will increase. Simply starting the Multiball is enough to count as completing a level. Collecting a set of 4 Jackpots during Raven Multiball will qualify the Raven **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)** and increase the Jackpot level.
  - Raven Boost - Raven’s boost works differently than the other four members’ boosters. Instead of being awarded off of **[Dragula](#heading--dragula)**, Raven Boost is qualified during Raven Multiball by shooting the left ramp three times and will increase the Jackpot values for a short time. Continuing to shoot the left ramp will increase the timer; if the timer runs out you will have to qualify the Raven Boost again by shooting the left ramp three times.
  - Raven Multiball Restart - A restart is available for Raven Multiball if two balls drain and the Super Jackpot wasn’t qualified. Shoot the left ramp on a 15 second timer to restart Raven Multiball with three balls in play.
  - Level 2 changes - During Raven II, every time the Jackpot is advanced, every unlit Jackpot will become available again.

## <span id="heading--majorfeatures"></span>Other Major Features

### <span id="heading--kitty"></span>Kitty (Playfield Multipliers)

Completing any **[Family Member](#heading--familymembers)** level will enable the Kitty Target to advance a playfield multiplier. The multiplier advances from 2x to 3x to 6x and lasts for about a minute. Hitting the Kitty Target while the playfield multiplier is active will reset the timer, and awards points and bonus multipliers.

### <span id="heading--superjackpots"></span>Super Jackpots

There are 10 (on the Pro) or 11 (on the Prem/LE) different ways to qualify the Dragula Lane for a Super Jackpot and **ALL** of them can stack on top of each other. The base value is 350k, which is raised by a small amount each time you shoot the unlit scoop. Shoot the Dragula Lane to collect any stacked Super Jackpots or hold the Zap Button to cancel the collect and continue stacking Super Jackpots.

**Available Super Jackpots:**

- [**Herman**](#heading--herman) - Collect four Jackpots during Herman Multiball.
- [**Spot**](#heading--spot) - Spell SPOT by completing four shots during Spot’s mode.

</div>

## <span id="heading--otherfeatures"></span>Other Scoring

### <span id="heading--teeth"></span>Chattering Teeth

Hitting any purple target collects one set of chattering teeth, and then will start flashing. Hit the flashing target again before it times out for 2 chattering teeth. Collecting chattering teeth allows the player to start **[Grandpa](#heading--grandpa)**’s modes at the scoop, and count up towards various other awards throughout the game:

- 12 - +1x bonus (Pro) / Light **Grandpa’s Laboratory** (Prem / LE)
- 24 - Light chattering teeth **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**
- 36 - +1x bonus
- 48 - Light **enlarging ray**
- 60 - +1x bonus
- 75 - **[+1x playfield](#heading--kitty)**
- 90 - Light **[mystery](#heading--mysteryaward)**
- 110 - Light **[extra ball](#heading--extraball)**
- 130 - Light **[secret mania](#heading--secret)**
- 160 - Light chattering teeth **Super Jackpot**
- 200 - +1x bonus (Pro) / Light **Grandpa’s Laboratory** (Prem / LE)
- 250 / 300 / 400+ - Super teeth (score bonus)

After playing **[Munster Madness](#heading--munstermadness)**, accumulated chattering teeth will reset to 0.

### <span id="heading--eddie"></span>Eddie

Shooting an unlit orbit or rolling over the flashing right inlane or outer left inlane will qualify the opposite orbit to score an Eddie Loop. Make successive Eddie Loops to score an increasing value, starting at 20k and increasing by 20k per loop. Every 5 Eddie Loops will qualify the Eddie **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)** if it isn’t already available.

### <span id="heading--marilyn"></span>Marilyn

Rolling through the flashing inner left inlane will light the right ramp to score a boyfriend departure. Every 2 boyfriend departures will score awards:

- Super pops
- Super spinner (spinner lit for 20k for 30 seconds)
- Super loops (loops lit for 100k for 40 seconds)

The Marilyn **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)** will also light at every 2 departures scored.

### <span id="heading--zapmeter"></span>Zap Meter

Hitting any standup target will make the Zap Button flash for a short time. Pressing the button will charge up the Zap Meter; the Zap Meter goes to 5. Zap Jackpots appear on shots where you have just made another type of jackpot, which decrements the Zap Meter. Collecting enough Zap Jackpots will qualify the Zap **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**.

### <span id="heading--dragula"></span>Dragula

Landing in the Dragula lane will increase the bonus multiplier, award points dependent on progress that has been made on the DRAGULA target, and “boost” a random character to make their modes score more. 5x can be qualified at the Dragula lane either by completing DRAGULA, or by shooting the lane a short time after it had been shot earlier.

### <span id="heading--addaball"></span>Add-A-Ball

During Multiball rounds, the Dragula lane can be lit to add a ball to the Multiball by spelling DRAGULA (or instantly, in the case of **[Raven Multiball](#heading--raven)**), which also awards a short ball saver.

### <span id="heading--mysteryaward"></span>Mystery Award

The scoop (or lower playfield VUK on Prem / LE) is lit at the start of the game to score a mystery award and light the Mystery **[Super Jackpot](#heading--superjackpots)**, and relights after collecting 90 **[chattering teeth](#heading--teeth)**. Awards collected on the Premium / LE that apply to the main playfield will start after **[Grandpa’s Laboratory](#heading--grandpa)** ends.

**Available Mystery Awards:**

- **[Start Member](#heading--familymembers)** (any of the five, even Raven if the advances at the left ramp are qualified)
- Boost Member (same as the boost awarded off of **[Dragula](#heading--dragula)**)
- Max Dragula (advances DRAGULA value to max and qualifies 5x Dragula instantly)
- Light **[Kitty](#heading--kitty)** (this is the only Mystery Award in tournament mode)
- Light **[Secret Mania](#heading--secret)**
- Light **[Extra Ball](#heading--extraballs)** (at the scoop)
- Light Special (at either outlane)

### <span id="heading--combos"></span>Combos

Make shots in succession to score combo points. These can be collected at any time during play. On the Premium / LE, combo rules also apply to Grandpa’s Laboratory.

### <span id="heading--secret"></span>Secret Mania

Originally an Easter egg in early code revisions, Secret Mania can now be lit at the Grandpa scoop in two different ways: either after collecting 130 **[chattering teeth](#heading--teeth)** or as a random **[mystery award](#heading--mysteryaward)**.

This mutually exclusive mode with fun, fast-motion animations lights all 7 family members’ areas for increasing scores starting at 200k + 25k per shot. Playfield multipliers apply to each award, and each individual area advances in value as more shots to it are made.

### <span id="heading--extraball"></span>Extra Balls and Special

An Extra Ball is available at the scoop through:

- Completing an adjustable amount of **[family member](#heading--familymembers)** levels
- Collecting 110 **[chattering teeth](#heading--teeth)**
- Percentage-based **[mystery award](#heading--mysteryaward)**.

Special can be qualified at the outlanes through a percentage-based **mystery award** or rarely from **[Kitty](#heading--kitty)**.

### <span id="heading--bonus"></span>Bonus

Bonus is a predetermined value (based on switch hits) plus 10k \* **[levels](#heading--familymembers)** completed, times the bonus multiplier (which goes up to 20x).

## <span id="heading--munstermadness"></span>Munster Madness (Wizard Mode)

This is a 4-ball Multiball wizard mode (using a 5th ball in Grandpa’s Laboratory on the Prem / LE). It can be started at the scoop by completing one level for all of the **[Family Members](#heading--familymembers)**, and after any modes already in progress have finished. Just like the other modes in this game, Munster Madness has two levels.

### Level 1

- **Stage 1:** Shoot three major areas three times in 15 seconds, in this order: Herman, Raven, Lily. This stage ends either when all areas have been completed or the timer for each area runs out. For subsequent cycles, Spot (left ramp target) and Grandpa (scoop) are added following Lily. On the Premium / LE model, you can also collect Jackpots in Grandpa’s Laboratory.

- **Stage 2:** Shoot the scoop to collect a Hurry-Up value determined by the points you collected during the previous stage. After collecting the Hurry-Up or having it time out, you will return to the previous stage where another hurry-up can be qualified (albeit with more shots).

### Level 2

- **Stage 1:** The mode starts by showing you instructions for all of the family members and what buffs they’ll award if you shoot their areas. Completing any family member will advance you to stage 2.

  - **Herman** - Additional ball save time once per round.
  - **Raven** - Lights Kitty once per round.
  - **Eddie** - Doubles every Jackpot awarded once per round.
  - **Marilyn** - Lights a Super Jackpot once per round.
  - **Lily** - Increased base scoring every round.
  - **Spot** - Boost *every* member every round.
  - **Grandpa**
    - **(Pro)** Lights add time (to the jackpot stage) every round until stage 3.
    - **(Prem/LE)** Enable Grandpa’s Laboratory for Jackpots every round until stage 3.

- **Stage 2:** The four major shots will all light for Jackpots. If Eddie has been completed, you will be able to shoot each Jackpot twice, and if Grandpa has been completed on the Premium / LE, you’ll be able to collect Jackpots in the Laboratory as well. The Jackpots are on a timer that resets if a Jackpot is collected; when the timer runs out, the stage will end and stage 1 will resume with the previous area not able to be selected.

- **Stage 3:** Once all seven areas have been completed, four successive shots are lit for Hurry-Ups with values corresponding to the amounts of Jackpots you collected in the previous two stages. The first Hurry-Up is based solely off of the Jackpots you collected, and the three following add the previous Hurry-Up value to the countdown. The shots lit to collect the Hurry-Up are lit one at a time, starting off at the left ramp and then moving to the right orbit, the right ramp, and then the left orbit. If any Hurry-Up times out or if they are all collected, you will return to Stage 1 once more.
