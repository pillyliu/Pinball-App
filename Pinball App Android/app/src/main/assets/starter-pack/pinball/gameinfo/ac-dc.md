AC/DC is a pinball machine by **Stern**, released in **2012**.

AC/DC is an incredible collaboration between Steve Ritchie, Lyman Sheats, and the rest of the team at Stern Pinball, based on everyone’s favorite band of sweating tiny Australian men. AC/DC offers a mix of strategic options, and challenges players to continue mixing up their play to meet the game’s goals. Three major game mechanics all work together: a player-selected song influences scoring, shots build up a collectible Song Jackpot, and everything (including the Song Jackpot) can be collected with a timed 2x or 3x playfield multiplier.
