Jurassic Park is a pinball machine by **Stern**, released in **2019**.

Jurassic Park is the second Stern Pinball machine designed by Keith Elwin. Directly after the events of the film, Nedry’s computer virus has continued to plunge the park into chaos - meaning the dinosaurs are loose and the employees are in danger. The player has to rescue as many staff as they can and capture the dinosaurs, all while trying to survive the horrors of the abandoned park and eventually staging an escape.
